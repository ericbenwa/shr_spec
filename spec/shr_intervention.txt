EntryElement:   CourseOfTreatment
Based on:       ProcedurePerformed
Description:    "A series of interventions, typically grouped in time and including several medications, tests, and/or procedures. A course of treatment may follow (with possible deviation) from a predetermined regimen, which provides a set of orders that result in instances of ProcedurePerformed, MedicationStatement, or MedicationAdministration. If the course of treatment is based on a known or defined regimen, the regimen name should be put into the TopicCode, and the start and stop dates recorded in the OccurrenceTimeOrPeriod. External identifiers for the regimen should be put into the Identifier."
