Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		finding
Description:	"The SHR Finding domain contains basic definitions used to capture subjective and objective information about the subject. Things observed about the subject can include demographic facts, history, subjective and objective observations, assessments, and judgments, excluding actual or potential interventions, and range from simple answered questions to vital signs and laboratory results."
Uses:			shr.core, shr.base, entity, condition

Element:		FindingContext
Based on:		StatementContext
Concept:		SCT#410514004
Description:	"The base class for representing the ontological status of a finding, e.g., present, absent, goal, risk, expectation, etc. This class aligns with the SNOMED Situation with Explicit Context.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, FindingContext includes the attribute 'status'. However, there are two problems with including FindingContext.status: (1) to align with FHIR, the datatype of status has to be Concept, but in CIMI, the datatype of status is Attribution, which can't be mapped. (2) Status might not have the same interpretation in all child classes. For example, in GoalContext, the status might be relative to the progress toward the goal, not really the same as the status of a finding."

Element:		EvaluationResultContext
Based on:		FindingContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class of contexts that can associate with EvaluationResultTopic and its subclasses."

Element:		AssertionContext
Based on:		FindingContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class of contexts that can associate with AssertionTopic and its subclasses."

Element:		PresenceAbsenceContext
Based on:		AssertionContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class for contexts asserting presence or absence of a finding."

	Element:		KnownOrSuspectedPresentContext
	Based on:		PresenceAbsenceContext
	Concept:		SCT#410515003
	Description:	"KnownOrSuspectedPresentContext indicates the finding in question exists or is present to some level of certainty. For example, if the finding involves a myocardial infarction, the presence context implies that cardiac arrest has (or may have) taken place. Note that the name Presence is used rather than Present to prevent confusion with the temporal meaning of present, i.e., the present time.
	
	In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this class is called KnownOrSuspectedPresent, but the name is being changed to include 'Context'. In addition, the class AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent is being collapsed into KnownOrSuspectedPresent, so the attributes of that class are included here."

	Element:		RecordedContext
	Based on:		EvaluationResultContext
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"Context for an evaluation result, used to indicate an evaluation has been made. For example, measurement of blood pressure that has been made simply exists (although the value can be present or absent, accurate or inaccurate). The RecordedContext indicates the information presented stands on its own as presented. It can also apply to a clinical notes.
	
	The RecordedContext class does not exist in CIMI Version 0.0.4, but CIMI is currently in the process of adding it. That change is anticipated here."

		Value:			code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-status
	
		Element:		RelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the finding addresses. The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium)."
		Value:			dateTime or TimePeriod 

		
Element: 		FindingTopic
Based on:		StatementTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Base class - independent of context - for all kinds of determinations: questions/answers, conditions, observations, allergies, and other findings. The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

In CIMI V0.0.4, FindingTopic has four attributes: result, description, multimedia, and intepretation. In this model, the result is captured as Value in AssertionTopic and EvaluationResultTopic. Description has been omitted for brevity. Multimedia has not yet come up in modeling discussions, and has been omitted, for now. Interpretation only applied to EvaluationResult (not Condition), and has been introduced in that class."


Abstract Element: AssertionTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The base topic for conditions, allergies, adverse events, etc. These are things that are asserted to exist or not. The Value is interpreted in the context of the class; for an AdverseSensitivityToSubstance, the value is the substance, for a Condition, the Value represents the type of condition found.

In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called Assertion, but CIMI recently decided to change its name to AssertionTopic, as anticipated here. In CIMI V0.0.4, Assertion defines three attributes: dateAsserted, verificationStatus, and findingMethod. VerificationStatus properly only applies in the KnownOrSuspectedPresentContext context, and can be found there."
Value:			0..1  CodeableConcept
		
Element:		EvaluationResultTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"The base class, independent of context for evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) and a value containing the result (answer). The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, because Observation.specimen is 0..1. Therefore, the cardinality of Specimen is changed to 0..1 to be consistent with FHIR.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related ('has-member') observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and so they are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model."
