Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		finding
Description:	"The SHR Finding domain contains basic definitions used to capture subjective and objective information about the subject. Things observed about the subject can include demographic facts, history, subjective and objective observations, assessments, and judgments, excluding actual or potential interventions, and range from simple answered questions to vital signs and laboratory results."

Element:		FindingContext
Based on:		Context
Concept:		SCT#410514004
Description:	"The base class for representing the ontological status of a finding, e.g., present, absent, goal, risk, expectation, etc. This class aligns with the SNOMED Situation with Explicit Context."


	Element:		PresenceContext
	Based on:		FindingContext
	Concept:		SCT#410515003
	Description:	"PresenceContext indicates the finding in question exists or is present to some level of certainty. For example, if the finding involves a myocardial infarction, the presence context implies that cardiac arrest has (or may have) taken place. Note that the name Presence is used rather than Present to prevent confusion with the temporal meaning of present, i.e., the present time."

	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"A simplified PresenceContext used to indicate an evaluation has been made. For example, measurement of blood pressure that has been made simply exists (although the value can be present or absent, accurate or inaccurate). The RecordedContext indicates the information presented stands on its own as presented. It can also apply to a clinical notes."

Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual findings that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself."
