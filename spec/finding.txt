Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		finding
Description:	"The SHR Finding domain contains basic definitions used to capture subjective and objective information about the subject. Things observed about the subject can include demographic facts, history, subjective and objective observations, assessments, and judgments, excluding actual or potential interventions, and range from simple answered questions to vital signs and laboratory results."

Element:		FindingContext
Based on:		StatementContext
Concept:		SCT#410514004
Description:	"The base class for representing the ontological status of a finding, e.g., present, absent, goal, risk, expectation, etc.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, FindingContext includes the attribute 'status'. However, there are two problems with including FindingContext.status: (1) to align with FHIR, the datatype of status has to be Concept, but in CIMI, the datatype of status is Attribution, which can't be mapped. (2) Status might not have the same interpretation in all child classes. For example, in GoalContext, the status might be relative to the progress toward the goal, not the same meaning as the status of a finding."

Element:		EvaluationResultContext
Based on:		FindingContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class of contexts that can associate with EvaluationResultTopic and its subclasses."

Element:		AssertionContext

Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class of contexts that can associate with AssertionTopic and its subclasses."


	Element:		PresenceContext
	Based on:		AssertionContext
	Concept:		SCT#410515003
	Description:	"PresenceContext indicates the finding in question exists or is present to some level of certainty. 
	
	For example, if the finding involves a myocardial infarction, the presence context implies that cardiac arrest has (or may have) taken place. Note that the name Presence is used rather than Present to prevent confusion with the temporal meaning of present.
	
	In CIMI Version 0.0.4, there were two classes, KnownOrSuspectedPresent and AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. CIMI has decided to combine these classes and rename them to PresenceContext, as represented here."

	Element:		RecordedContext
	Based on:		EvaluationResultContext
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"Context for an evaluation result, used to indicate an evaluation has been made. 
	
	For example, measurement of blood pressure that has been made simply exists (although the value can be present or absent, accurate or inaccurate). The RecordedContext indicates the information presented stands on its own as presented. It can also apply to a clinical notes.
	
	The RecordedContext class did not exist in CIMI Version 0.0.4, but CIMI is the process of adding it. That change is anticipated here."

		Description:	"Indicates whether the finding is preliminary, amended, final, etc.."
		Value:			code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-status
	
		Element:		RelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the finding addresses.
		
		The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium)."
		Value:			dateTime or TimePeriod 

Element: 		FindingTopic
Based on:		StatementTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Base class - independent of context - for all kinds of determinations: questions/answers, conditions, observations, allergies, and other findings. 

The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

In CIMI V0.0.4, FindingTopic has four attributes: result, description, multimedia, and intepretation. Here, result is represented by EvaluationResultTopic.Value and AssertionTopic.Value. Description and Multimedia have been omitted for brevity. "

		Element:		Interpretation
		Concept:		MTH#C0420833

		Element:		FindingMethod
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The technique used to create the finding, for example, the specific imaging technical, lab test code, or assessment vehicle. In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this attribute is called 'method'."
		Value:			CodeableConcept should be from http://loinc.org

Abstract Element: AssertionTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The base topic for conditions, allergies, adverse events, etc. These are things that are asserted to exist or not. The Value is interpreted in the context of the class; for an AdverseSensitivityToSubstance, the value is the substance, for a ConditionPresenceStatement, the Value represents the type of condition found.

In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called Assertion, but CIMI recently decided to change the name to AssertionTopic, as anticipated here. In CIMI V0.0.4, Assertion defines three attributes: dateAsserted, verificationStatus, and findingMethod. VerificationStatus properly only applies in the PresenceContext context, and can be found there. FindingMethod more properly belongs in FindingTopic, and can be found there."

Element:		EvaluationResultTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"The base class, independent of context for evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) and a value containing the result (answer). 

The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

CIMI Differences:
1) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, because Observation.specimen is 0..1. Therefore, the cardinality of Specimen is changed to 0..1 to be consistent with FHIR.
2) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related ('has-member') observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and so they are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model.
3) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, allowable datatype for result include EmbeddedContent,  GpsLocation,  Multimedia,  ParsableContent, and other types not allowed in a FHIR Observation. To make mapping feasible, the types of Value were restricted to the allowable FHIR datatypes."

		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The specific aspect, person, or thing related to the Subject under observation, potentially a specific condition, fetus, drug regimen, environmental location, activity, body structure, or environmental factor. 
		
		Focus is used when the observation is not the Subject as a whole. An example would be an observation related to a particular tumor, or an observation about a change in a particular behavior, or an observation about a systemic condition.
		
		CIMI Version 0.0.4 does not have this attribute, nor does FHIR 3.0.1. However, a FHIR tracker issue has been approved for adding an attribute (tentatively named focalSubject) to FHIR. That change is anticipated here."
