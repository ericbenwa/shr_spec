<h1><a name="Terminology Overview"></a>Terminology Overview</h1>

<h2>Terminology Approach</h2>

<p>This implementation guide supplies terminology bindings drawn primarily from LOINC for "observables", and SNOMED-CT for values, results and findings. There are a few exceptions to this: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When appropriate codes are not available in the preferred vocabulary, alternative vocabularies are used, in the following order of preference: SNOMED-CT (if the element is an observable), NCI Metathesaurus, and local codes;
        </li>
        <li>When LOINC is used to specify an observable and LOINC specifies a normative answer list for that term, the normative list is used instead of an equivalent SNOMED CT value set.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>FHIR Terminology</h2>

<p>Value sets from the FHIR specification are reused to the extent possible. Specifically, and while this guide was produced for FHIR DSTU2, the model makes an attempt to provide seemless integration of multiple FHIR versions. This </p>

<h2>Local Value Sets</h2>

<p>This guide includes multiple value sets created specifically to support the terminology needs of the models. These value sets where created only when no known existing value sets were deemed to be fit for purpose, or when existing value needs needed to be extended.</p>

<p><strong>There is a known issue with HL7's FHIR implementation guide publisher that causes an error in the expansion of local value sets in the implementation guide. While this prevents the value sets from being shown in the value set pages, the content of the value sets is correctly expanded in json and xml, which readers can access from the indivual value set pages.</strong></p>

<h2>Exception Values</h2>

<p>FHIR structurally separates missing value reasons (exception values) from answer sets. For example, FHIR uses two attributes, Observation.value and Observation.dataAbsentReason. For this reason, when LOINC answer lists included missing value explanations, those answers were separated and placed in a separate value set.&nbsp;However, we note that LOINC answer sets are not very consistent with regard to missing value reasons, and possibly incomplete. This leaves open a question on what a cross-cutting normative set of missing value reasons or exception values might be.</p>

<h2>Cancer Staging and Proprietary Terminologies</h2>

<p>The AJCC staging system is recognized as one of the most widely-used standards for cancer staging. However, this guide does not include any AJCC terminology due to unresolved copyright issues. As such, <strong>elements related to staging may not currently include required terminology bindings</strong>.</p>
