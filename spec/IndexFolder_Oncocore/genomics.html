<h1><a name="genomics"></a>Genomics Reporting</h1>

<p>Genomics is the study of the totality of DNA sequence and gene expression differences between tumor cells and normal host cells. It aims to understand the genetic basis of tumor cell proliferation and the evolution of the cancer genome under mutation and selection by the body environment, the immune system and therapeutic interventions (source: <a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/cancer-genomics">Nature</a>).</p>
<p>mCODE will only include the minimal set of genetic related elements relevant to capture in an EHR to drive treatment options. </p>
<p>mCODE's initial emphasis on a minimal set of elements to drive treatment, there is no immediate need to model and store whole sequence reads that would be sent from an NGS labs.  Rather, only the relevant genetics labs test results and variant names and interpretation, noted by Sync for Genes as levels 1 and 2, would suffice. Subsequently, the mCODE implementation mapped to the <a href = "https://www.hl7.org/fhir/genomics.html#observation-genetics">observation-genetics profile</a> as much as possible.</p>

<h3><i>Genetic Test Identifiers</i></h3>
<p>mCODE allows for different coding systems like the Logical Observation Identifiers and Names (LOINC) and local codes to specify the genomics test or panel provided that a the coding system or ID convention is specified.  While <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/">Genetic Testing Registry (GTR)</a> is currently the best source for identifying genetic tests, the user should be aware that the GTR cannot be a sole reliable source since the test data is voluntarily updated and there is no overarching data steward. </p>
