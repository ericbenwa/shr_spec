Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		allergy
Description:	"The SHR Allergy domain contains definitions for statements dealing with substance-related risks, particularly, allergies and intolerances."
Uses:			shr.core, shr.base, entity, medication, adverse

CodeSystem:     SCT = http://snomed.info/sct
CodeSystem:		CAT = http://hl7.org/fhir/allergy-intolerance-category


EntryElement:	AllergyIntolerance
Based on:		ConditionOrObservation
Concept:		SCT#473010000 "Hypersensitivity condition (disorder)"  
// or SCT#420134006 "Propensity to adverse reactions (disorder)"?
Description:	"A finding related to the presence of an individual's risk or sensitivity to a substance or class of substances. Per US Core specification, the result includes SNOMED codes representing 'No known allergy'. In AllergyIntolerance, the reactions are included in-line, rather than referencing to conditions (in contrast to AdverseEvent)."

				Element:	SubstanceCode
				Concept:	TBD
				Description: "The substance triggering a particular allergy or intolerance reaction event. The substance may be the same as the substance cited in the AllergyIntolerance, but should be a specific substance rather than a class of substances, if known. For example, if the allergy intolerance DataValue substance is 'shellfish' the substance code for the reaction might be 'oyster'."
				Value:	    CodeableConcept from http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet-us-core-substance.html if covered




/* Probably the most consistent way to define the absence (no known) allergy is to use an absence assertion, but this is not the way US Core has decided to go. Comments here are for reference only.
