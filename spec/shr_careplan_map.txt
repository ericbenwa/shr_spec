Goal maps to Goal:
// Includes attributes inherited from ActionContext and Entry
		Entry.FocalSubject maps to subject
		Entry.Informant maps to expressedBy
		SpecificType maps to description
		Status maps to status
		Category maps to category
		Reason[Condition] maps to addresses
		OccurrenceTime[date] maps to start[x].date
		OccurrenceTime[TimePeriod].TimePeriodStart[date] maps to start[x].date
		ExpectedPerformanceTime[TimePeriod].TimePeriodEnd[date] maps to target.due[x].date
		ResultAchieved[CodeableConcept] maps to outcomeCode
		Annotation maps to note

Objective maps to Goal:
		Entry.FocalSubject maps to subject
		Entry.Informant maps to expressedBy
		SpecificType maps to description  // TODO Should this map (or additionally map) to target.measure?
		Status maps to status
		Category maps to category
		Reason[Condition] maps to addresses
		OccurrenceTime[date] maps to start[x].date
		OccurrenceTime[TimePeriod].TimePeriodStart[date] maps to start[x].date
		ExpectedPerformanceTime[TimePeriod].TimePeriodEnd[date] maps to target.due[x].date 
		//AssociatedGoal becomes extension
		ResultTargeted[Quantity] maps to target.detail[x].Quantity
		ResultTargeted[Range] maps to target.detail[x].Range
		ResultTargeted[CodeableConcept] maps to target.detail[x].CodeableConcept
		ResultAchieved[CodeableConcept] maps to outcomeCode  
		// TODO FHIR should align its outcome types to target.detail types (you can the target as a quantity, but outcome can only be a Codeable Concept)
		Annotation maps to note
		Evidence maps to outcomeReference

CarePlan maps to CarePlan:
		// constrain intent to #plan -- it's a care PLAN, for Pete's sake
		constrain replaces to 0..0
		constrain basedOn to 0..0
		constrain partOf to 0..0  // There's no need for nested care plans. The patient can have several plans for different purposes, just like several medications, but they don't have to be grouped under a master care plan
		constrain supportingInfo to 0..0
