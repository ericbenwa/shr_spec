Element:		ClinicalStatement
Based on:		InformationEntry
Concept:		TBD
Description: 	"A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context. 
The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model."
