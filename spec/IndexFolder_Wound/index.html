<h1><a name="Background"></a>Background</h1>

<p>The use case under consideration involves repeated assessments of the same wound that can occur at different times during the clinical course of the wound. These multiple assessments trace a relationship to a persistent representation of a wound condition by means of a wound identifier.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Purpose</h1>

<h1></h1>Considerations</h1>
Are the profiles valid?
Can the profiles express the clinical need?
Do the profiles mesh together to form a coherent and accurate picture?
Are the relationships between the profiles correct?
Are the correct codes and value sets used?




<h1><a name="Modeling"></a>Modeling Wounds and Skin and Wound Assessments</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The other key to our approach representing each wound by a condition. A wound is an identifiable entity located at a particular body site that maintains its identity over a period of time. As such, a wound has properties indicative of a condition, including onset time and abatement time. Explicitly representing the wound allows multiple observations about the wound to refer back to the same wound.</p>

<p>The wound is modeled as a condition, and assessments are modeled as complex observations (with components and related observations).</p>
<p>One of the key features of wound assessment is that observations have a hierarchical structure of containment with 1-to-many relationships at each level. For example, a patient can have multiple wounds, each wound can have multiple tunnels, and each tunnel on each wound on each patient can have a measured length. This presents a modeling challenge.</p>
<p>In this implementation, we use components when appropriate and sub-observations where necessary. Panel-type sub-observations are required where the panel observations themselves have sub-observations or components.</p>
