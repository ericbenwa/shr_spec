<h2><a name="Terminology"></a>Terminology Approach</h2>
<p>The implementation guide supplies terminology bindings drawn primarily from LOINC and SNOMED CT. Laboratory tests are identified by LOINC codes, where available, while coded answers have primarily been drawn from SNOMED CT. An exception to this rule is where LOINC is used to identify a test and LOINC specifies a normative answer list that is not specified in SNOMED CT, in which case, the LOINC normative answer codes were used.</p>

<p>Where terminology gaps were identified, requests for terminology additions have been initiated. For the purposes of this IG, gaps have been covered either with local codes, or codes from NCI metathesaurus.</p>
