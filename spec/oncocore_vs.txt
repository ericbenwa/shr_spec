ValueSet:     CancerBodyLocationVS
Description:  "Codes describing the location(s) of primary or secondary cancer. The value set includes all codes SNOMED-CT body structure hierarchy. The cancer body location may also be expressed using ICD-O-3 topography codes, however, those codes are not included here due to intellectual property restrictions. No other code systems are considered conformant."

ValueSet:   HistologyMorphologyBehaviorVS
Description: "Codes representing of the structure, arrangement, and behavioral characteristics of tumors and cancer cells. Codes are preferrably taken from the SNOMED CT hierarchy under 108369006 Neoplasm (morphologic abnormality). ICD-O-3 morphology codes (including behavior suffix) can also be used. For primary cancers, the ICD-O-3 behavior suffix should be /1, /2, or /3. For secondary cancers, the ICD-O-3 behavior suffix should be /6 or /9. Only SNOMED CT and ICD-O-3 are considered conformant to the specification."

ValueSet:		CancerBehaviorVS

The behaviour digit can be 0 (benign), 1 (uncertain behaviour), 2 (carcinoma in situ), 3 (malignant, primary site), 6 (malignant, metastatic site), or 9 (malignant, uncertain whether primary or metastatic site)."
