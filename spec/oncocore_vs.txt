ValueSet:     CancerBodyLocationVS
Description:  "Codes describing the location of primary or secondary cancer. The value set includes all codes SNOMED-CT body structure hierarchy. The cancer body location code can also come from ICD-O-3 topography codes, however, those codes are not included here due to intellectual property restrictions. Because the value set binding is extensible in the information model, use of ICD-O-3 topography codes conform to mCODE requirements."
Includes codes descending from SCT#123037004  "Body Structure"

ValueSet:   HistologyMorphologyBehaviorVS
Description: "The histologic type codes can be taken either from ICD-O-3 morphology codes (including behavior suffix) or SNOMED CT neoplasm morphology codes. For primary cancers, the ICD-O-3 behavior suffix should be /1, /2, or /3. For secondary cancers, the ICD-O-3 behavior suffix should be /6 or /9. The ICD-O-3 codes are not included here due to intellectual property restrictions, but the value set binding is extensible, so ICD-O-3 codes conform to mCODE requirements."

/*
ValueSet:		CancerBehaviorVS
Description:	"The morphologic behavior of the cancer, which corresponds to the suffix to the ICD-O-3 histologic type codes. Codes are presented as local codes because they are portions of the full code to be post-coordinated, and not full ICD-O-3 codes. The behaviour digit can be 0 (benign), 1 (uncertain behaviour), 2 (carcinoma in situ), 3 (malignant, primary site), 6 (malignant, metastatic site), or 9 (malignant, uncertain whether primary or metastatic site)."
