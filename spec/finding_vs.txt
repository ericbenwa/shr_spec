ValueSet: 					ExceptionValueVS
Description:				"Reasons that a value associated with a test or other finding is missing."
#unknown					"The value is not known."
#asked						"The source human does not know the value."
#temp						"There is reason to expect (from the workflow) that the value may become known."
#not-asked					"The workflow didn't lead to this value being known."
#masked						"The information is not available due to security, privacy or related reasons."
#unsupported				"The source system wasn't capable of supporting this element."
#astext						"The content of the data is represented in the resource narrative."
#error						"Some system or workflow process error means that the information is not available."
#NaN						"NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value."
#not-performed				"The value is not available because the observation procedure  (test, etc.) was not performed."
#missing_refused			"Human source was asked but declined to respond to the question, or an applicable question was left unanswered."
#missing_noexplanation		"The reason the information is not present is not known."
#missing_nonesuch			"The answer is missing because nothing of a type of thing is known to exists, e.g., the siblings of an only child. Also use this code to represent a 'none of the above' answer"
// The following values apply to lab tests
#missing_collection			"Missing due to a problem collecting, identifying, or locating the specimen, including patient refusal or unable to provide specimen"
#missing_specimen			"Missing due to a problem with the specimen, e.g. inadequate specimen, contamination, clotting, improper tube type, improper storage, too small, etc."
#missing_malfunction		"Missing due to instrument malfunction."

//SCT#410605003		"Confirmed present"
//SCT#410591008		"Definitely present"
SCT#410515003		"Known present"

ValueSet:			DiagnosticServiceVS
Description:		"The type of laboratory service used in producing a laboratory result"
#microbiology		"Laboratory concerned with cultures, to look for suspected pathogens."
#parasitology		"Laboratory responsible for examining parasites, feces samples may be examined for evidence of intestinal parasites such as tapeworms or hookworms and others."
#virology			"Laboratory concerned with identification of viruses in specimens such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid."
#hematology 		"Laboratory that works with whole blood to do full blood counts, and blood films as well as many other specialised tests."
#biochemistry		"Laboratory that usually receives serum or plasma and tests the serum for chemicals present in blood."
#toxicology 		"Laboratory that mainly tests for pharmaceutical and recreational drugs. Urine and blood samples are submitted to this lab."
#immunology			"Immunology/Serology laboratory uses the concept of antigen-antibody interaction as a diagnostic tool. Compatibility of transplanted organs is also determined."
#Immunohaematology	"Laboratory or blood bank that determines blood groups, and performs compatibility testing on donor blood and recipients. It also prepares blood components, derivatives, and products for transfusion."
#urinalysis 		"Laboratory tests urine for many analytes. Some health care providers have a urinalysis laboratory, while others don't."
#pathology 			"Surgical, cytopathology, or histopathology laboratory. Surgical pathology examines organs, limbs, tumors, fetuses, and other tissues biopsied in surgery such as breast mastectomies."
#genetics 			"Laboratory that mainly performs DNA analysis."
#cytogenetics 		"Laboratory that uses blood and other cells to get a karyotype. This can be helpful in prenatal diagnosis (e.g. Down's syndrome) as well as in cancer (some cancers have abnormal chromosomes)."
