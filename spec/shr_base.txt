Uses:			shr.core


//------------ BASE CLASSES----------------
/* PRINCIPLES:
1) NO CONCEPT MODEL --- THAT'S TERMNOLOGY - this means we will never have a type hierarchy
2)  FLAT, PURPOSE-AGNOSTIC LIST OF OBSERVATIONS AND ASSERTIONS THAT CAN BE GROUPED AS NEEDED
3)  NO NEED TO DISTINGUISH "STAND-ALONE" FROM "COMPONENT" OBSERVATIONS, OR PANELS FROM "COMPOUND OBSERVATIONS"
4) ALL COMPUTABLE INFORMATION IN CODES -- CLASS NAMES ARE CONSIDERED NON-COMPUTABLE AND CANNOT BE RELIED UPON AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A HUMAN-READABLE DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENTS
5)  OPEN-WORLD ASSUMPTION 
* just because something isn't stated, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist
* something stated to NOT exist, does not exist
