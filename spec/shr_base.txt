Grammar:	DataElement 4.1
Namespace:		shr.base
Description:		"The SHR Base domain contains definitions for elements that are widely shared in SHR, including the base Entry and associated metadata."
Uses:				shr.core, shr.demographics, shr.actor, shr.encounter, shr.device

//---------------  Missing Information -----------------------

Element:		MissingValueReason
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The reason a required element, complex type, or primitive value is missing. Missing value reason can be substituted for any value. By convention in SHR, any required element or value can be substituted with a missing value reason."
Value: 			CodeableConcept from MissingValueReasonVS

// ------------   Modifiers  -----------------------

Element:		NonOccurrenceModifier 
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"When true, indicates either that the event or action documented in the entry did not occur. For example, if immunization is not given, the NonOccurrenceModifier=true will indicate this.
When applied to a recommendation, the modifier indicates the action mentioned in the topic should not take place. For example, a request to NOT elevate the head of a bed using the code for elevating the bed, and setting ProhibitedModifier to true. Other examples include do not ambulate, do not flush NG tube, do not take blood pressure on a certain arm, etc. If the SpecificType contains negation and ProhibitedModifier is true, that will reinforce the prohibition, and should not be interpreted as a double negative that equals a positive."
Value:			boolean
0..1			Reason   // The reason that an event or action did not occur


Element:		AssertionNegationModifier
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"When true, this modifier indicates that the associated observation, assessment, or finding is false, the condition is absent. For example, if the assessment is 'allergy to peanuts' and the AssertionNegationModifier is true, it means the subject does not have an allergy to peanuts."
Value:			boolean
