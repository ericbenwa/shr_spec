Description:	"A question-answer or phenomena-present/absent pair, independent of context. 
A dependent data element lacks sufficient context for full interpretation, e.g., a reference to a patient, problem, or body structure, whereas a finding includes the necesssary context. A data element consists of an observable property or item (represented by a code), value or present/absent, and optionally, an exception value and reference range. Data elements can be included in observations as components."
Value:			0..1 (Quantity or CodeableConcept or string or Range or Ratio or time or dateTime or TimePeriod)   
// exclude boolean because component doesn't include it, although Observation does; exclude Media because it is not present in FHIR v4
