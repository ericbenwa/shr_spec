<p>This a MITRE version of a Wound Assessment FHIR Implementation Guide, based on Standard Health Record (SHR) core classes.</p>
<h1>Wound Assessment</h1>
<p>The use case under consideration is that repeated assessments of the same wound can occur at different times during the clinical course of the wound. These multiple assessments trace a relationship to the same wound by means of a common wound identifier.</p>
<h2>Dealing with Nested Observations</h2>
<p>One of the key features of wound assessment is "nestedness", a hierarchical structure of containment with 1-to-many relationships at each level. One patient can have multiple wounds, each wound can have multiple tunnels, and each tunnel on each wound on each patient can have a measured length. This presents a modeling challenge.</p>
<p>In this implementation, we take a hybrid approach, using components wherever possible, and sub-observations where necessary. Panel-type sub-observations are required where the panel observations themselves have sub-observations or components.</p>
<p>The other key to our approach representing each wound by a condition. A wound is an identifiable entity located at a particular body site that maintains its identity over a period of time. As such, a wound has properties indicative of a condition, including onset time and abatement time. Explicitly representing the wound allows multiple observations about the wound to refer back to the same wound.</p>
