<p>This is a &ldquo;Full CIMI&rdquo; version of a Skin and Wound Assessment FHIR Implementation Guide, based on CIMI based classes, and employing topic-context flattening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The Skin and Wound Assessment Demonstration Project</h1>
<p>&nbsp;The Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) is focused on creating logical models of healthcare information, independent of implementation technologies and patterns, decoupling clinical content from periodic changes in implementation technology. This Implementation Guide (IG) is part of a demonstration project showing how different groups, with different tools, approach CIMI modeling. To expedite comparison, each group has implemented the same Skin and Wound Assessment domain.</p>
<h1>Approach</h1>
<h2>Dealing with Nested Observations</h2>
<p>One of the key features of wound assessment is &ldquo;nestedness&rdquo;, a hierarchical structure of containment with 1-to-many relationships at each level. One patient can have multiple wounds, each wound can have multiple tunnels, and each tunnel on each wound on each patient can have a measured length. This &ldquo;nestedness&rdquo; leads to design choices about how to model the &ldquo;sub-observations&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approaches to deal with the hierarchical nature of wound assessment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A component approach, where sub-observations are inseparable parts of a parent observation, or</li>
<li>A panel approach, where sub-observations are independent observations, gathered into a parent panel observation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either approach is feasible, and each has pros and cons. A pure component approach keeps everything related to a single wound assessment together, but requires complicated mapping to FHIR, since FHIR observation components cannot have sub-components. A pure panel approach is also feasible, and nicely modular, but that approach leads to problems pairing up related observations, such as wound tunnel length and clock direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this implementation, we take a hybrid approach, using components wherever possible, and sub-observations where necessary. To be clear, panel-type sub-observations are required where the panel observations themselves have sub-observations or components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other key to our approach representing each wound by a condition assertion (FindingSiteConditionPresenceStatement). A wound is an identifiable entity located at a particular body site that maintains its identity over a period of time. As such, a wound has properties indicative of a condition, including onset time and abatement time. Explicitly representing the wound allows multiple observations about the wound to refer back to the same wound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use case we have in mind is that many assessments of the same wound can occur at different times during the clinical course of the wound. These multiple assessments trace a relationship to the same wound by means of a common wound identifier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Flattening the Topic-Context Pattern</h2>
<p>Using the topic-context pattern introduces additional decisions. It was difficult to orchestrate the various classes that must come together to represent the wound assessment panel. Therefore, the author decided to flatten out the topic-context pattern. To do this, the context hierarchy was combined with the clinical statement hierarchy, creating one hierarchy. Topic was then folded into the appropriate places to form a complete clinical statement. With this simplification, decisions on which of the three classes to extend were eliminated.</p>
