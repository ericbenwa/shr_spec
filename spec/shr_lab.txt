EntryElement:	Specimen
Based on:		Entity
Description:	"Sample for analysis"
1..1			Type from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0487
0..1			AccessionIdentifier
0..1			Status
0..1			SourceSpecimen
0..1			ref(SpecimenCollectionPerformed)
0..1			ref(SpecimenContainer)
0..*			SpecimenTreatment
0..*			HandlingRisk
0..*			SpecialHandling



Element:		AccessionIdentifier
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Identifier assigned by the lab"
Value:			Identifier

Element:		SourceSpecimen
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Identifier for the source specimen from which this specimen was derived."
Value:			ref(Specimen)

Element:		SpecimenType
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Kind of material that forms the specimen"
Value:			CodeableConcept

Element:		HandlingRisk
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Cautions on the handling of this specimen."
Value:			CodeableConcept

Element:		SpecialHandling
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Information about the proper handling of the specimen."
Value:			CodeableConcept


EntryElement:	SpecimenContainer
Based on:		Entity
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Direct container of specimen (tube&#47;slide, etc.)"
0..1			Type   //"Kind of container holding the specimen - e.g. a vial or well."
0..1			Identifier
0..1			Description
0..1			Capacity
0..1			SpecimenQuantity
0..*			Additive
0..1			AdditiveCode
0..1			SequenceNumber
// BALLOT: SpecimenContainer should inherit from Entity. It is a physical object, and not only that, but if it inherited from Entity, it wouldn't have to define identifier and description again.		
// BALLOT: SpecimenContainer.AdditiveCode should be 0..* to match Additive (0..* Substance). I think the idea is that there can be multiple additives. 
// BALLOT: In SpecimenContainer, SpecimenQuantity (datatype Quantity) describes the amount of specimen. SpecimenCollection breaks out amount of specimen in a number of individual attributes: amount, volume, dimension, and size. Which is the best way to do this? Shouldn't we be consistent about how we refer to the size or amount of a specimen?


Element:		Capacity
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Container volume or size."
Value:			Quantity

Element:		SpecimenQuantity
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Quantity of specimen within container."
Value:			Quantity

Element:		Additive
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Additive associated with container."
Value:			Substance   // ref(Substance) ??

Element:		AdditiveCode
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Additive associated with container."
Value:			CodeableConcept
// BALLOT: SpecimenContainer.Additive and SpecimenContainer.AdditiveCode have exactly the same description. The descriptions must distinguish them.
// BALLOT: SpecimenContainer.AdditiveCode should be a CodeableConcept (currently a CodeableConcept). The name says code, so it should be a code.

Element:		SequenceNumber
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The sequence number for this specimen in a collection of specimens."
Value:			CodeableConcept
// BALLOT: Why is SpecimenContainer.SequenceNumber a CodeableConcept? It should be an integer or a string. I don't think the sequence number will ever be coded, and CodeableConcept  datatype is specifically designed for code mapping.


EntryElement:	SpecimenTreatment
//Based on:		ProcedurePerformed
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Treatment performed on the specimen."
0..1			Description
0..1			ProcessingProcedure
0..*			Additive


Element:		ProcessingProcedure  
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A coded value specifying the procedure used to process the specimen."
Value:			CodeableConcept

EntryElement:	HIVSupplementalTestRequest
Based on:		LaboratoryProcedureRequested
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A request for a confirmatory or additional test for HIV infection."
1..1			Type from HIVSupplementalTestCodeVS
