Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		shr.base
Description:	"The SHR Base domain contains definitions for basic classes in SHR."
Uses:			shr.core, finding, entity


Abstract Element:	Locatable 
Concept:			TBD
Description:		"Abstract top level class in the hierarchy. Locatable defines the idea of 'locatability in an archetyped structure'. Having this class at the top of the class hierarchy reflects CIMI's use of Archetype Description Language (ADL). In CIMI, Locatable brings with it three attributes that occur in every CIMI child class: archetype_node_id, name (not a healthcare-relevant name, but a name created at runtime), and archetype_details. These attributes reflect a CIMI model implementation detail, and are irrelevant to cancer detailed clinical models, and should by rights remain hidden. So as to not complicate all profiles with extra extensions, these three attributes have been omitted."

Element: 		Entry
Based on:		Locatable
Concept:		MTH#C1705654
Description:	"An Entry is the minimal unit independent of logical information or knowledge, such as a clinical statement in a patient record, a knowledge entry in a knowledge artifact, a product in a product catalog, etc. Entry contains attributes that apply to all such items. An Entry may represent an item in a single person's health record, or could represent an entity that surfaces in multiple patient records, such as organizations or practitioners.

This class corresponds to Entry in CIMI V0.0.4. However, the CIMI-defined attributes from Entry (and InformationEntry) have been omitted from this model because the mapping to Entry to FHIR DomainResource is problematic. FHIR's standard set of attributes in DomainResource (id, versionId, lastUpdated, profile, security, tag, implicitRules, language, text, contained, extension, modifierExtension) are quite different than CIMI's standard set of attributes (namely: identifier, subjectOfInformation, attribution, additionalText, recordStatus). Reconciling these differences is outside the scope of the current ballot on breast cancer. "

Element:		ClinicalStatement
Based on:		Entry
Concept:		TBD
Description: 	"A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context. The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed."

Abstract Element:	StatementTopic
Based on:		Locatable
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of attributes that make up the clinical focus of an entry. A topic does not include contextual attributes such as the nature of the action (ordered, proposed, planned, etc.), the nature of the patient state being described (e.g., present, suspected present, absent), and the attribution of this information (the who, when, where, how, why of the information recorded)."
1..1			TopicCode

		Element:		TopicCode	
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement. For actions, the key represents the action being described. For findings, the key represents the 'question' or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the key contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings (which by nature lack an explicit question), the key contains a default concept signifying that an assertion is being made. In all cases, the key describes the topic independent of the context of the action or the finding.
		
		This attribute was named 'key' in CIMI V0.0.4. Recently, CIMI has recently moved to rename this element TopicCode, as anticipated here, to make it more clear that this is an identifier for the topic, not the context."
		Value:			CodeableConcept


Abstract Element:	StatementContext
Based on:		Locatable
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of attributes that provides the context for the topic of a clinical statement. StatementContext provides the expressivity required to specify that an act was performed or not performed or that a finding was asserted to be present or absent for the given subject of information."
1..1			ContextCode

		Element:		ContextCode	
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code ontological status of the statement, e.g., whether it exists, does not exist, is planned, etc. Attribute aligns with the SNOMED CT Situation with Explicit Context (SWEC) Concept Model context attributes: 'Finding context (attribute)' (SCTID: 408729009) and 'Procedure context (attribute)' (SCTID: 408730004). The range allowed for this attribute shall be consistent with the SNOMED CT concept model specification for SWEC.
		
		This attribute was named 'type' in CIMI V0.0.4. However, CIMI has recently moved to rename this element ContextCode, as anticipated here, to make it more clear that this is an identifier for the context, not the topic."
