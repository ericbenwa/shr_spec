EntryElement:	Condition
Concept:		MTH#C0348080
Description:	"A representation of a disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, risk, functionality, concern, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, worry, or trouble. Condition can be used to track a problem or a risk over a period of time. By virtue of its continuity over time, Condition is different from an Observation or Assessment; Observations represents evidence, and an Assessment is a judgment based on evidence and rendered at a point in time. Diagnosis is a type of Assessment that can lead to creation of a Condition (as can an assessment of risk). The two relate because observations can lead to conclusion that a Condition exists. A statement that a certain condition does not exist should be an assessment. Not all conditions are problems, but all problems are (in some sense) conditions."
