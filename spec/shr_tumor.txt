EntryElement:   TumorPresent
Based on:	BodyStructurePresent
Concept:        SCT#395557000 "Tumor finding (finding)"
Description:    "The presence of an abnormal mass of tissue (neoplasm) that results when cells divide more than they should or do not die when they should. Tumors may be benign (not cancer), or malignant (cancer). (source: NCI Dictionary)."
                FindingTopicCode from TumorMorphologyVS
// note - like other existential findings, the topic code is WHAT is present or absent, and the result code is present or absent (in this case, present)

EntryElement: 	TumorMargins
Based on:		CodedLaboratoryObservation
Concept:		MTH#C4086369
Description:	"The edge or border of the tissue removed in cancer surgery. The margin is described as negative or clean when the pathologist finds no cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has been removed. The margin is described as positive or involved when the pathologist finds cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has not been removed."
