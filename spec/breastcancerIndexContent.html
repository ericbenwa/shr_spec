<h2>Guidance for HL7 Voters</h2>
<p>This is a For-Comment ballot for the Breast Cancer Interoperability FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) sponsored by Clinical Information Council (CIC) Work Group, co-sponsored by the Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI), and created by the HL7 Cancer Interoperability Group, with input from providers, medical professional societies, vendors, and government organizations.</p>
<h3>Reviewing the Ballot Materials</h3>
<p>There are several representations in the ballot materials. Each representation reflects the same content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clinicians and cancer domain experts</strong> should primarily focus on the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/logical.html">logical models</a>. This is the simplest representation of the content included in the ballot. <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/valuesets.html">Value sets</a> will also be of interest.</li>
<li><strong>The FHIR community and FHIR implementers</strong> should primarily focus on <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/profiles.html">FHIR Profiles</a>and related matter (extensions, value sets, etc.</li>
<li><strong>The CIMI community</strong> should focus primarily on the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/modeldoc/index.html">reference model</a> that shows how the oncology model derives from the CIMI Reference Model. Reviewers should bear in mind that since the CIMI Reference Model is in a state of flux, it is difficult to say to what extent the breast cancer model is "CIMI Conformance". See <a href="#CIMI">Relationship to CIMI</a> for more information. The CIMI community should also inspect the mappings between the breast cancer model and the FHIR profiles. The mappings are found on selected profile pages, on the Text Summary tab. Mappings are not part of all profiles because mappings can be inherited. For example, the mapping of breast cancer diagnosis is entirely based on the mapping found in <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-breastcancer/StructureDefinition-oncology-BreastCancerPresenceStatement.html">ConditionPresenceStatement</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions for Commenters</h3>
<p>The sponsoring work groups and the Cancer Interoperability Group are seeking both general and specific comments regarding this material.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the content dealing with breast cancer staging complete and correct from a clinical point of view?</li>
<li>Are there other initiatives or projects that also deal with cross-cutting data standards for breast cancer that should be taken into account?</li>
<li>Is the way the ballot material is presented suitable and useful? If not, what type of format(s) would be more informative?</li>
<li>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a single ballot contains CIMI models, FHIR logical models, and FHIR Profiles, all related to eachother. As such, we are interest in whether the voters find such an approach useful.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Breast Cancer Interoperability FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) contains a subset of logical models for breast cancer focused on data elements used for breast cancer staging. FHIR profiles are provided as an example physical representation of the logical models. This IG also serves as a pilot for the Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI).</p>
<h2><a name="Background"></a>Background</h2>
<p>Several oncology data models exist today. They were created by specialized communities and for specific purposes like generating synoptic reports for pathology, developing oncology treatment plans, reporting to cancer registries, and supporting clinical documentation in an oncology EHR. There is no clear agreement among these models, further complicating the seamless exchange of structured and coded data among these disparate systems. And yet, there is general consensus on the need to have a common set of data elements that allows for the seamless exchange of oncology data as one proceeds through the cancer patient journey of care.</p>
<p>The HL7 Cancer Interoperability (CI) Project aims to address this concern with the goal of modeling cancer data in a way that can be used for the diagnosis, treatment, and research of cancer. The project is a collaboration of a diverse multidisciplinary group, involved in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, but also the cancer research and surveillance communities.</p>
<h2><a name="Scope"></a>Scope</h2>
<p>The IG covers oncology-specific data necessary support breast cancer treatment and research, focusing first and foremost on data driving clinical decision-making for medical and surgical oncologists. The first iteration of this guide is focused on breast cancer staging. The data required for staging involves several clinical domains and specialties, including medical oncology, surgical oncology, and anatomic pathology. The <em>American Joint Commission on Cancer 8th Edition Staging Manual</em> (AJCC-8) defines the elements used in staging breast cancer. These include TNM categories as well as other factors that are known to influence the prognosis of breast cancer patients, including: tumor grade, hormone receptor status (progesterone and estrogen), as well as human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER 2) status, among others.</p>
<p>Over time, we expect the IG will incrementally evolve to cover a wider range of clinical domains (e.g. radiology, clinical genomics, interventional radiology), and expand its scope to include other key areas for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment (e.g. radiation therapy, chemotherapy), while supporting secondary data use in for clinical research, cancer registry reporting.</p>
<h2><a name="CIMI"></a>Relationship to CIMI</h2>
<p>The HL7 Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) is co-sponsoring this project. To the extent possible, the breast cancer staging model has been based on the CIMI reference model. The last "official" release of that model was Version 0.0.4, for the January 2018 ballot. The ballot resolution process is still underway, and as a result, CIMI's reference model is undergoing active review and significant revisions. This raises the question of what it means to be "using CIMI" at this point in time. The model has adopted the following strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>The breast cancer model is primarily aligned with V0.0.4.</li>
<li>It also reflects some changes to CIMI subsequent to V0.0.4, where those changes are known and have been approved in the CIMI WG.</li>
<li>In still other cases, the model departs from CIMI, primarily due to FHIR mapping exigencies. These departures may indicate areas where either FHIR or the CIMI reference model might have to be more closely aligned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Differences between the breast cancer class hierarchy and the CIMI reference model are documented in the individual classes where they occur.</p>
