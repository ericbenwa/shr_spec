<p> This is a Breast Cancer Interoperability FHIR implementation guide. </p>

<p> The purpose of this implementation guide (IG) is to provide detailed clinical models and FHIR Profiles that are required to support reliable and consistent capture and exchange of data in the breast oncology domain. </p>
<p>The IG covers oncology-specific data necessary support breast cancer treatment and research, focusing first and foremost on data driving clinical decision-making for medical and surgical oncologists. The first iteration of this guide is focused on breast cancer staging. The data required for staging involves several clinical domains and specialties, including medical oncology, surgical oncology, and anatomic pathology. The American Joint Commission on Cancer 8th Edition Staging Manual (AJCC-8) defines the elements used in staging breast cancer. These include the traditional TNM staging components (anatomic staging), as well as other factors that are known to influence the prognosis of breast cancer patients, including: tumor grade, hormone receptor status (progesterone and estrogen), as well as human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER 2) status, among others.</p> 
<p>Over time, we expect the IG will incrementally evolve to cover a wide variety of clinical domains (e.g. radiology, clinical genomics, interventional radiology), and expand its scope to include other key areas for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment (e.g. radiation therapy, chemotherapy), while supporting secondary data use in for clinical research, cancer registry reporting.</p>
<p>This IG was developed through the collaboration of a diverse multidisciplinary group, involved in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, but also the breast cancer research and surveillance communities.</p>
