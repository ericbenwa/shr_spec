ValueSet:       TumorMarkerVS
Description:    "A tumor marker is a substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (noncancer) conditions. This value set of LOINC codes will include a comprehensive list of tumor markers across all cancers, and regardless of method or specimen type. Subsets specific to a cancer type will be created as needed. Sources vary but include https://labtestsonline.org/tests/tumor-markers."
// as a prototype, only a couple of examples of tumor markers will be included in this list.  
// An automated script which imports tumor markers from LOINC (similar to the way eCQMs are bulk imported)
// can easily be created.
