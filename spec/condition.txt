Abstract Element:	ConditionTopic
Based on:		AssertionTopic
Concept:		MTH#C0348080
Description:	"Representation of a condition, independent of context of being present, absent, risk, expectation etc. 'Condition' is interpreted broadly to include disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, concern, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, etc. 

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the corresponding reference model class was called ConditionAssertion. The CIMI name is being changed to ConditionTopic (perhaps ConditionAssertionTopic), as anticipated here. In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the ConditionAssertion has properties associated with the presence of the condition, including severity, dueTo, diseasePhase, and more. In the current logical model, the properties associated with the occurrence of a condition have been placed (more appropriately) with ConditionPresenceContext.

The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR Condition.category and enforce the extensible binding in US Core of Condition.code) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model. The constraints could only exist in an archetype derived from the reference model class. The logical model here represents both the class structure and the terminology bindings."

Element:		ConditionPresenceContext
Based on:		PresenceContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The context for a condition that is known, suspected, or possibly present.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this class was called AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. The corresponding CIMI class is ungoing a name change to include the word 'StatementContext' and remove the word 'Assertion'.

The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR clinicalStatus, severity, and criticality) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model. The constraints could only exist in an archetype derived from the reference model class. The logical model here represents both the class structure and the terminology bindings."

			Element:		ClinicalStatus

			Description:	"A flag indicating whether the condition is active or inactive, recurring, in remission, or resolved (as of the last update of the Condition)."
			Value:			code

			Element:		Onset
			Concept:		MTH#C0277793
			Description:	"The beginning or first appearance of a mental or physical disorder.
			This attribute aligns with FHIR Condition.onset, and with dateOfOnset and ageAtOnset in CIMI Version 0.0.4 but includes additional datatypes corresponding to FHIR"
			Value:			dateTime or Age or TimePeriod or Range or string

			Description:	"The end of the condition, either remission or resolution. This attribute corresponds to dateAbated and hasAbated in CIMI Version 0.0.4, but includes additional datatypes corresponding to FHIR"
			Value:			dateTime or Age or boolean or TimePeriod or Range or string

			Element:		Severity
			Concept:		MTH#C0392364
			Description:	"Degree of harshness or extent of a symptom, disorder, or condition."
			Value: 			CodeableConcept 

			Element:		Criticality
			Concept:		MTH#C3858539 "Criticality"
			Description:	"The potential clinical harm associated with a condition. When the worst case result is assessed to have a life-threatening or organ system threatening potential, it is considered to be of high criticality."
			Value:			code

			Element:		Stage
			Concept:		MTH#C0699749
			Description:	"The relative advancement in the course of a disease. The value is the summary stage or stage group. StageDetail optionally contains the full staging information.
			
			This attribute does not have a direct analogy in CIMI V0.0.4 (the closest being ConditionAssertion.diseasePhase), but is included here for consistency with FHIR and because staging is important in the context of breast cancer and cancer in general."

Element:		Condition  // aka Condition Present
Based on:		ConditionTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A condition that is or may be present in a subject. 'Condition' is interpreted broadly and could be a disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, worry, or trouble.

In CIMI terms, it is an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines a ConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext context. The attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included here because of mapping difficulties.

In CIMI V0.0.4, this class would be represented as an archetype, specifically, a ClinicalStatement whose topic is ConditionAssertion and whose context is AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. The name of the CIMI archetype has not been determined as of V0.0.4;. Here, the class is called Condition because it corresponds to FHIR Condition."
