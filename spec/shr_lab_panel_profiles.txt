EntryElement:   CBCWAutoDifferentialPanel
Based on:       HeadlessLaboratoryPanel
Description:    "Complete blood count (CBC) with auto differential panel. Includes various measures of red blood cells, platelets, and various types of white blood cells and other related measures, such as hemoglobin. The components of this panel are not entirely standardized, so the definition of the CBC includes tests that are optional, or performed by certain laboratories but not others. Therefore, instances typically will include a subset of the listed panel members. While recognizing scalability limitations, in this case, panel member is described by its own FHIR profile. 

Note to FHIR implementers: The Argonaut and US Core IGs both state that panels (related groups of observations) should be represented by the DiagnosticReport resource. mCODE deviates from this approach by using Observation for panels. This is because panels can contain other panels, but a DiagnosticReport cannot contain other DiagnosticReports. Nested panels are, in fact, quite common in LOINC (see 39135-9 Wound assessment panel for an example of a deeply nested panel). To represent nested panels, the each sub-panel _must be_ an Observation. Of course, any sub-panel can also be a stand-alone panel, as well. Following the Argonaut/US Core recommended approach of using DiagnosticReport would imply that many or perhaps all panels would have to be represented twice: once as an Observation to permit the panel to be used as a sub-panel, and once as a DiagnosticReport to permit it to be used as a top-level panel. The mCODE authors believe there is little added value in representing panels as DiagnosticReports when Observation provides additional opportunity for nesting, and equivalent expressive power."
