EntryElement:	PersonEmploymentStatus
Based on:		CodedSocialHistoryObservation
Description:	"The self-reported current and historical data about a person's economic relationship to work (e.g. having one or more jobs), including start and end dates.
A person's Employment Status could change over time, for example, a person could be employed following a period of choosing to not be in the labor force.
Outside of ODH, the employment arrangement between an employer and a person (one job) has sometimes been referred to as a person's 'employment status.' However, in ODH Employment Status is used to characterize a person, Work Classification is used to characterize a job, and Retirement Date is used to characterize a person as retired."

EntryElement:	RetirementDate
Based on:		SocialHistoryObservation
Description:	"A self-reported date that a person considers themselves to have ‘retired’.
A person can be both retired and employed (an Employment Status); most often, a person would be retired from one job and employed in another job. A person also can have more than one retirement date; for example, a person could retire from military service, then later retire from a civilian job. Multiple retirement dates should be recorded using multiple FHIR resources.
Outside of ODH, a characterization of the employment arrangement between an employer and a person (one job) has sometimes been referred to as a person's 'employment status' and might include values such as 'retired.' However, in ODH Employment Status is used to characterize a person's relationship to working (e.g., employed, unemployed) and Retirement Date is used to characterize whether or not a person self-identifies as retired. For example, a person could be 'employed' (Employment Status) and have retired from a previous job (recorded at the Person level as a Retirement Date)."

EntryElement:	UsualWork
Based on:		CodedSocialHistoryObservation
Description:	"Related data elements about the work a person reports having performed for the longest amount of time during his or her life, regardless of the person's current job and regardless of whether or not the person performed this work for a continuous time.
Knowledge of person's Usual Work can potentially assist in diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of chronic condition(s) or conditions with a long latency. The potential for exposure to Occupational Hazard(s) related to an Occupation and/or an Industry can change over time, and a person could have been in and out of their Usual Work over time, so additional data are helpful to fully evaluate the possible impact of the person's Usual Work on their health and guide appropriate use of screening tests to detect early disease.
Example: a person has worked for a total of 30 years as a 'secretary' (Occupation), but in various industries, mostly hotel construction. Her Usual Occupation is 'secretary' and her Usual Industry is 'hotel construction.'
Usual Work does not include work that was unpaid or voluntary."

EntryElement:	PastOrPresentJob
Based on:		CodedSocialHistoryObservation
Description:	"Related data elements for a current or previous job, as reported by the person, i.e., a work situation or position held for a specified time period.
A person can have more than one job at the same time and multiple jobs over time, so the data related to each job must remain in the record in perpetuity. Each job should be recorded in a separate instance of PastOrPresentJob.
A person's job can be a social determinant of their health and information about a person's job can support patient care, population health, and public health. In patient care, knowledge of a person's past or present job(s) can impact recognition, diagnosis, management, and treatment of injuries and illnesses. These data also can be used for clinical decision support and to prompt discussion of preventive care measures. For example, a record of jobs that require prolonged time in the sun might prompt a health care provider to inquire if the person wears protective clothing or sunscreen while working. 
At a minimum, it is important to have a record of a person's current job(s); i.e., the job(s) in which a person is engaged at the time that he or she presents to a health care provider, regardless of duration, and to retain that information over time. In the event a person recently stopped working (e.g. retired without another job, became unemployed or disabled and unable to work), the most recent job(s) is used instead of the current job(s)."
