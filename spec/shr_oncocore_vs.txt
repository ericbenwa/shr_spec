ValueSet:   CancerHistologicTypeVS
Description: "Neoplasm (morphologic abnormality)"
Includes codes descending from SCT#108369006 "Neoplasm (morphologic abnormality)"

ValueSet:  TumorMorphologyVS    
Description:  "Neoplasm (morphologic abnormality)"
Includes codes descending from SCT#108369006 "Neoplasm (morphologic abnormality)"

ValueSet:		MorphologyBehaviorVS
Description:	"The morphologic behavior of the cancer. These are the suffix to the ICD-O-3 histologic type codes. Codes are presented as local codes because they are portions of the full code to be post-coordinated, and not full ICD-O-3 codes."
#0				"Benign"
#1				"Uncertain whether benign or malignant"
#2				"In situ"
#3				"Malignant, primary site"
#6				"Malignant, metastatic site"
#9				"Malignant, uncertain whether primary or metastatic site"


ValueSet:   CancerProgressionVS   
Description: "The course of a disease, such as cancer, as it becomes worse or spreads in the body. (source: NCI Dictionary)"
SCT#103338009 "In full remission (qualifier value)"
SCT#385633008 "Improving (qualifier value)"
SCT#58158008  "Stable (qualifier value)"
SCT#230993007  "Worsening (qualifier value)"

ValueSet:		  CancerProgressionEvidenceVS
Description:  "The type of evidence backing up the clinical determination of cancer progression."
//SCT codes are all children of the SCT#386053000 "Evaluation procedure (procedure)"
SCT#363679005 "Imaging (procedure)"
SCT#252416005 "Histopathology test (procedure)"
SCT#711015009 "Assessment of symptom control (procedure)"
SCT#5880005   "Physical examination procedure (procedure)"
MTH#C0005516	"Biological markers"

ValueSet:		CancerStageTimingVS
//TODO: the value set is missing codes for recurrence and anatomical staging.
//TODO: need new terms for post-therapeutic clinical and pathological staging.
Description:	"When staging was done, relative to treatment events (qualifier)."
SCT#385349001   "Clinical stage (observable entity)"
//#cli		    "Clinical stage: Staging performed prior to surgery, based on evidence such as physical examination, imaging, and/or biopsy."
SCT#405978005   "Pathologic stage (observable entity)"    //TODO_discussion: using SCT instead of local codes, we lose the definition. Also strange to use an observable in a value set.
//#path         "Pathologic stage: Staging performed based on examination of tissue samples removed during surgery, in addition to physical examination and imaging."
#postther_cli   "Post-therapeutic (post-neoadjuvant) clinical staging based on clinical examination after the first treatment with systemic drugs or radiation, when no surgery has been performed."
#postther_path  "Post-therapeutic (post-neoadjuvant) pathologic staging, based  on tissue samples removed during surgery after the first treatment with systemic drugs or radiation."

ValueSet:   CancerStagingSystemVS   // replaces local value set in BrCa spec
Description: "The system used to identify cancer/tumor stage"
Includes codes descending from SCT#254292007 "Tumor staging (tumor staging)" //TODO: consider staging systems in NCI MTH and determine if there are gaps.

ValueSet:   TNMTumorStagingSystemVS    // TODO: Need to include version of staging system (this is not sufficient)
Description:    "System used for TNM classification."
// RM 12/19/2018: < SCT#254293002 includes content from SCT that is at best misguided, at worst incorrect. The terms focus on the cancer type (prostate, breast) rather the edition of the TNM staging system.  
//Includes codes descending from SCT#254293002 "Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) tumor staging system (tumor staging)"
  SCT#444256004 "American Joint Commission on Cancer, Cancer Staging Manual, 6th edition neoplasm staging system (tumor staging)"

  SCT#258235000 "International Union Against Cancer (tumor staging)"

ValueSet:   CancerStageSuffixVS
Description: "Modifiers related to the staging category. Examples of modifiers include the type of procedure performed in determining the pathological node classification. The staging suffix notation is the abbreviation enclosed by parentheses.  For example, CN1a(sn) where (sn) designates that the N category was identified based on a sentinel node biopsy."
#sn     "sentinel node biopsy"
#f      "Fine needle aspiration or core biopsy"
