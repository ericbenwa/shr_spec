ValueSet:		CancerStageTimingVS
//TODO: the value set is missing codes for recurrence and anatomical staging.
//TODO: need new terms for post-therapeutic clinical and pathological staging.
Description:	"When staging was done, relative to treatment events (qualifier)."
SCT#385349001   "Clinical stage (observable entity)"
//#cli		    "Clinical stage: Staging performed prior to surgery, based on evidence such as physical examination, imaging, and/or biopsy."
SCT#405978005   "Pathologic stage (observable entity)"    //TODO_discussion: using SCT instead of local codes, we lose the definition. Also strange to use an observable in a value set.
//#path         "Pathologic stage: Staging performed based on examination of tissue samples removed during surgery, in addition to physical examination and imaging."
#postther_cli   "Post-therapeutic (post-neoadjuvant) clinical staging based on clinical examination after the first treatment with systemic drugs or radiation, when no surgery has been performed."
#postther_path  "Post-therapeutic (post-neoadjuvant) pathologic staging, based  on tissue samples removed during surgery after the first treatment with systemic drugs or radiation."

ValueSet:   CancerStagingSystemVS   // replaces local value set in BrCa spec
Description: "The system used to identify cancer/tumor stage"
Includes codes descending from SCT#254292007 "Tumor staging (tumor staging)" //TODO: consider staging systems in NCI MTH and determine if there are gaps.

ValueSet:   TNMTumorStagingSystemVS    // TODO: Need to include version of staging system (this is not sufficient)
Description:    "System used for TNM classification."
Includes codes descending from SCT#254293002 "Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) tumor staging system (tumor staging)"

ValueSet:   CancerStageSuffixVS
Description: "Modifiers related to the staging category. Examples of modifiers include the type of procedure performed in determining the pathological node classification. The staging suffix notation is the abbreviation enclosed by parentheses.  For example, CN1a(sn) where (sn) designates that the N category was identified based on a sentinel node biopsy."
#sn     "sentinel node biopsy"
#f      "Fine needle aspiration or core biopsy"
