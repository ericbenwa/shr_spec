EntryElement:	Person
Based on:		ObjectExistence
Concept:		TBD#TBD
				ObjectCode is SCT#125676002 "Person (person)"

EntryElement:	PersonRole
Based on:		ObjectExistence
Concept:		TBD#TBD
Description:	"The capacity in which an actor is involved in an activity or environment. For instance, 'attending physician' or 'research subject'.
The difference between role and type is that type is constant, while role can change depending on the activity or setting. Note that attributes of the actor (the subject) remain constant regardless of the role the actor plays should be part of the subject and not the role. For instance, a person may be a practitioner and a patient. In both cases their date of birth will be the same and thus such information should not be part of the role."
