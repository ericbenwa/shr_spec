			Element:		GeneStudied
			Description: "A gene targeted for mutation analysis using HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) notation. The required code is HGNC gene ID. Gene IDs are of the format HGNC:n, where n is a unique number. Only the number, n, should be given as the code. For example, the HGNC identifier for the EGFR gene is 3236. The display text associated with the code should be the HBNC official gene symbol. For example, the official gene sysbol for epidermal growth factor receptor is EGFR."

EntryElement:	TumorMarkerObservation
Based on:		LaboratoryObservation
Concept:		LNC#21924-6 "Tumor marker Cancer"
Description:	"A substance found in tissue or blood or other body fluids that may be a sign of cancer or certain benign (noncancer) conditions. Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). (Source: [NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/tumor-marker/)).  Tumor markers differ from genetic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis."
