EntryElement:	MedicationStatement
Based on:		MedicationExposure
Concept:		SCT#416608005 "Drug therapy (procedure)"  // TODO: investigate whether we need a new code or use a drug concept.
Description:	"A record of the use of a medication. If the medication is given as part of a course of treatment, the PartOf attribute should refer to the CourseOfTreatment.
Although FHIR supports the asserter (information source) and date asserted, it does not have a place for the recorder (who recorded the statement). SHR adds the recorder as an extension, as part of standardizing clinical statements.
Medication not taken has changed from DSTU2 and STU3 to R4. In R4, status and statusReason are used to indicate medications not taken. SHR does not allow the MedicationStatement to represent not taking a drug, fixing taken to yes (y), and setting the cardinality for reasonNotTaken to 0..0. Status values can be used to indicated 'stopped' or 'not taken' if those values are available in a given FHIR version.
ReasonCode is a choice of CodeableConcept or ref(Condition) in DSTU2, and limited to one reason. In STU3 and R4, there can be multiple reason codes, and multiple reason references, simultaneously."

EntryElement:	MedicationAdministration
Based on:		MedicationExposure
Description:	"A record of the use of a medication. If the medication is given as part of a course of treatment, the PartOf attribute should refer to the CourseOfTreatment.
Although FHIR MedicationAdministration supports date of administration and performer, it lacks common provenance elements, creation date, asserter, and recorder. These are supported as optional extensions.
FHIR DSTU2 lacks a category attribute, which is provided as an extension in that version.
SHR does not allow the 'not given' attributes from DSTU2 and STU3, since they are dropped in R4. The status element is used to document medications not given."

	Element:		NumberOfRefillsAllowed
	Description:	"The maximum number of times the dispense can be repeated. For medication dispense, this integer does NOT include the original order dispense.

Description:	"Information on the ability and cooperation of the patient in taking medicine or supplement as recommended or prescribed. This includes correct timing, dosage, and frequency. The SubjectOfInformation can reference a specific medication.

Modeling note: MedicationAdherence could be attached to MedicationStatement directly as an extension, but modeling as an observation avoids creating an extension and allows this observation to be made at any time, independent of any specific medication."
