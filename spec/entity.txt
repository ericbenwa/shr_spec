Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		entity
Description:	"The SHR Entity domain contains definitions for objects, people and organizations that are involved with the person of record, in some capacity. Entities are things that have separate and distinct existence and objective or conceptual reality. Includes information items, physical objects, health states, and parties."
Uses:			shr.core, shr.base, finding

CodeSystem:		NCI = https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/

Abstract Element:	Entity
Based on:			Any
Concept:			TBD
Description:		"Base class for human, material, and informational things. A non-material thing might be a goal or information relevant to health care, such as an image, consent form, or report. A material thing can be seen and touched, such as a device.

In CIMI V0.0.4, Entities were not stand-alone classes. However, this is currently being changed in CIMI, so in the future, CIMI entities will more closely correspond to the FHIR entity-like resources such as Organization, Location, Device, Substance, and the like. In order to map to FHIR and produce profiles for this ballot, this change has been anticipated.

Further, in CIMI V0.0.4, Entity was a subclass of Party. Party is part of CIMI's participation model that is currently undergoing review and revision. Rather than introducing the complexity the CIMI participation model, which has little relevance to the current ballot of cancer profiles and is undergoing revision anyway, the superclass Party has been omitted."
			
Element:		BodySite
Based on:		Entity
Concept:		MTH#C1545955
Description:	"A location or structure in the body, including tissues, regions, cavities, and spaces, for example, right elbow, or left ventricle of the heart.

Note: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the corresponding reference model class is called AnatomicalLocation. This class corresponds to that CIMI reference model class, but it would be defined in a CIMI archetype, because it involves value set bindings on each of the attributes."

	Element:		PortionTotality
	Concept:		NCI#C99075
	Description:	"Further detail of the anatomical location or specimen detailing whether it includes the entire entity or only a part or portion. NOTE: This attribute is not part of CIMI. It was included because it further details an anatomical location or specimen, in Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM)."
