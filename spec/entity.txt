Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		entity
Description:	"The SHR Entity domain contains definitions for objects, people and organizations that are involved with the person of record, in some capacity. Entities are things that have separate and distinct existence and objective or conceptual reality. Includes information items, physical objects, health states, and parties."
Uses:			shr.core, shr.base, finding

CodeSystem:		NCI = https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/

Abstract Element:	Entity
Based on:			Locatable
Concept:			TBD
Description:		"Base class for human, material, and informational things. A non-material thing might be a goal or information relevant to health care, such as an image, consent form, or report. A material thing can be seen and touched, such as a device.

In CIMI V0.0.4, Entities were not stand-alone classes. However, this is currently being changed in CIMI, so in the future, CIMI entities will more closely correspond to the FHIR entity-like resources such as Organization, Location, Device, Substance, and the like. In order to map to FHIR and produce profiles for this ballot, this change has been anticipated.

Further, in CIMI V0.0.4, Entity was a subclass of Party. Party is part of CIMI's participation model that is currently undergoing review and revision. Rather than introducing the complexity the CIMI participation model, which has little relevance to the current ballot of cancer profiles and is undergoing revision anyway, the superclass Party has been omitted."

			
Element:		AnatomicalLocation
Based on:		Entity
Concept:		MTH#C1545955
Description:	"A location or structure in the body, including tissues, regions, cavities, and spaces, for example, right elbow, or left ventricle of the heart.

Note: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, AnatomicalLocation has no parent class. This appears to have been an oversight, and the parent should have been Entity, as modeled here. This class corresponds to that CIMI reference model class, but it would be defined in a CIMI archetype, because it involves value set bindings on each of the attributes."
Value:			CodeableConcept from AnatomicalLocationVS
0..1 			Laterality
0..1			Directionality
0..1 			PortionTotality


	Element:		Laterality
	Concept:		MTH#C0925205 "Anatomical laterality"
	Description:	"Anatomical location or specimen further detailing the side(s) of interest."
	Value:			CodeableConcept from LateralityVS

	Element:		Directionality
	Concept:		NCI#C99074
	Description:	"Anatomical location or specimen further detailing directionality.
	Note: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this is called anatomicalDirection."
	Value:			CodeableConcept from DirectionalityVS

	Element:		PortionTotality
	Concept:		NCI#C99075
	Description:	"Further detail of the anatomical location or specimen detailing whether it includes the entire entity or only a part or portion. NOTE: This attribute is not part of CIMI. It was included because it further details an anatomical location or specimen, in Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM)."
	Value:			CodeableConcept from PortionTotalityVS


Element:		AnatomicalLocationOrCode
Description:	"A body site entity or a body site code."
Value:			CodeableConcept from AnatomicalLocationVS or AnatomicalLocation


Element:	Specimen
Based on:		Entity
Description:	"Sample for analysis. 

NOTE: This class has been cut down to separate it from other parts of the reference model that are not relevant to the current oncology ballot."

0..1			CollectionSite


		Element:		SourceSpecimen
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Identifier for the source specimen from which this specimen was derived.
		
		In CIMI V0.0.4, this attribute is called parentSpecimenIdentifier (datatype Identifier). The corresponding element in FHIR (Specimen.parent) is type ref(Specimen). It is impossible to map Idenfier to Specimen, so the datatype of this element has been changed to make the mapping feasible."
		Value:			ref(Specimen)
		
		Element:		CollectionTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"When the sample was obtained, as a specific time or time period.
		
		Specimen collection time seems to be missing in CIMI V0.0.4. Given that is not in Specimen, the next place to look is in the associated CollectionProcedure, specifically in the Performance context of the clinical statement representing that procedure. But there is no time found there, either, only a temporalContext (type Concept) and duration (not a point in time). If the specimen collection time is supposed to be recorded in Performance.Attribution (a list of actions), it would be nearly impossible to create a mapping."
		Value:			dateTime or TimePeriod
		
		Element:		CollectionMethod
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"How the specimen was obtained."
		Value:			CodeableConcept	
		
		Element:		CollectionSite
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The body site where specimen was collected"
		Value:			AnatomicalLocation
