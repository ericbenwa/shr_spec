Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		shr.observation
Description:	"The SHR Observation domain contains basic definitions used to capture subjective and objective information about the subject."
Uses:			shr.base, shr.core, shr.demographics, shr.actor, shr.lab, shr.medication, shr.condition, shr.procedure, shr.device


EntryElement: 	Observation
Based on:		EvaluationResult
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"An observation includes direct results of observing, measuring, or evaluation. The topic of an observation can include the subject's behavior, relationships, functional status, environment, exposures, etc. The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual."

		Element:		ResultStatus
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Labels the result as preliminary, amended, final, etc."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from ObservationCategoryVS if covered

		Element:		Interpretation
		Concept:		MTH#C0420833
		Description:	"A clinical interpretation of a measurement."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-interpretation

		Element:		ChangeFlag
		Concept:		MTH#C1705241
		Description:	"Indicator of significant change (delta) from the last or previous measurement."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from ChangeFlagVS

		Element:		ObservationQualifier
		Concept:		MTH#C1443279
		Description:	"A description of the conditions or context of an observation, for example, under sedation, fasting or post-exercise. Body position and body site are also qualifiers, but handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ReferenceRange
		Concept:		MTH#C0883335
		Description:	"The usual or acceptable range for a test result."
		Value:			Range   // TODO: align this with FHIR

		Element:		Components
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Observation Components are parts of the parent observation. Component observations share the same attributes (such as Specimen) as the primary observation and are not separable. However, the reference range may be different for each component observation."
		Value:			0..* ObservationComponent
		

Element:		ObservationComponent   // not Content (cannot stand alone)! 
Description:	"A simplified, non-separable observation consisting of a type code, value (or data absent reason), reference range, and interpretation. The item observered is the same as in the parent observation."
Value:			0..1 (Quantity or CodeableConcept or string or boolean or Range or Ratio or Media or time or dateTime or TimePeriod)

0..1			DataAbsentReason
0..1			Interpretation
0..*			ReferenceRange
		
			

EntryElement:	Panel
Concept:		TBD
Based on:		Observation  // inherit from Observation because a Panel might involve a shared specimen
Description:	"A grouped set of related findings, frequently captured at the same time. An example is a complete blood count (CBC), with separate observations for hemoglobin, hematocrit, etc. Could represent the content of a diagnostic report, such as a pathology report. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual findings that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself. The panel and all its sub-observations share the same metadata (provenance)."
0..0			Value
1..1			Members

		Element:		Members
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Members represent the elements of a group of a related observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent observation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author."
		Value:			0..* ref(Finding)				

		
		/* Orphans
		Element:		ServiceCategory
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This is used for searching, sorting and display purposes."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ReportStatus
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The status of the report associated with this panel."
		Value:			code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/diagnostic-report-status
