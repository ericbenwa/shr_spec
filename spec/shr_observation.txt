Description:		"The SHR Observation domain contains basic definitions used to capture information about measurements, lab tests, and assessments."

EntryElement: 	Observation
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Based on:		Action
Description:	"An Observation represents evidence, both subjective and objective. Observation includes any information about a subject that results from an act of observing, measuring, or evaluation. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, health state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. An Observation contains information about the act of observing or measuring, and the result of the observation. The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual."

		Element:		ObservationCode
		Based on:		ActionCode
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A term from a controlled vocabulary that defines the data element (the question, not the answer) as specifically as possible. The specific code should always align with the concept of the element, but may be more specific. For example, the concept associated with medications is code for 'medication used', but the ObservationCode is the code for the particular medication used. For tests, ObservationCode identifies the specific test being performed, and for observations, the specific question being asked."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ObservationCategory
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A categorization of the observation according to how the observation was collected or its clinical area."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category /* or CodeableConcept */

		Element:		ObservationReason
		Concept:		TBD
		Based on:		Reason
		Description:	"The reason for making the observation."

		Element:		ObservationNonOccurrenceModifier
		Concept:		TBD
		Based on:		NonOccurrenceModifier
		Description:	"True if the observation did not occcur, e.g., if a test was not performed or the assessment was not done, when it might otherwise be expected."
						Reason with CodeableConcept from ObservationNotMadeReasonVS

		Element:		AssociatedStudy
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The clinical trial or other formal study related to this finding."
		Value:			ref(Study)

		Element:		ObservationQualifier
		Concept:		MTH#C1443279
		Description:	"A description of the conditions or context of an observation, for example, under sedation, fasting or post-exercise. Body position and body site are also qualifiers, but handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		Method
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The method of the observation, for example, the specific imaging technical or assessment vehicle."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ClinicallyRelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the observation addresses. The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium)."
		Value:			GeneralizedTemporalContext

		Element:		DataAbsentReason
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Provides a reason why the value of the observation is missing, if it is expected (some observations are not expected to have a value)."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ReferenceRange
		Concept:		MTH#C0883335
		Description:	"The usual or acceptable range for a test result."
		Value:			TBD "Range"   // TODO: align this with FHIR

		Element:		PanelMembers
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"PanelMembers represent the elements of a group of a related observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent observation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author."
		Value:			0..* 			ref(Observation)


Element:		ObservationComponent
Description:	"A simplified observation consisting of a type code, value (or data absent reason), reference range, and interpretation. Can be used in place of an observation when a full observation cannot be mapped, for example, in the components of an observation. Note that although Status is required, the value is not mapped to FHIR and is essentially ignored."

0..1			DataAbsentReason
0..1			Interpretation
0..*			ReferenceRange

		Element:		ServiceCategory
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This is used for searching, sorting and display purposes."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ReportStatus
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The status of the report associated with this panel."
		Value:			code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/diagnostic-report-status


EntryElement:	Panel
Concept:		TBD
Based on:		Observation
Description:	"A grouped set of related observations, frequently captured at the same time. An example is a complete blood count (CBC), with separate observations for hemoglobin, hematocrit, etc. Could represent the content of a diagnostic report, such as a pathology report. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual observations that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself. The panel and all its sub-observations share the same metadata (provenance)."

EntryElement:	BodyStructureObservation
Concept:		MTH#C1268086
Description:	"Observation of the existence (or non-existence) distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds. The observation has a body site that allows the the structure to be located in the body. The observation identifier allows other observations of the same body structure to be related to QualitativeValueScaleVSthis observation and tracked over time."
