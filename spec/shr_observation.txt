Grammar:	DataElement 4.1
Namespace:	shr.observation
Description:		"The SHR Observation domain contains basic definitions used to capture information about measurements, lab tests, and assessments."
Uses:		shr.base, shr.core, shr.demographics, shr.actor, shr.lab, shr.medication, shr.problem


EntryElement: 	Observation
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Based on:		Action
Description:	"Information about a subject that results from an act of observing, measuring, or evaluation. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, health state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. An observation contains information about the act of observing, as well as the result of the observation. The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual."

		Element:		ObservationTypeCode
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A term from a controlled vocabulary that defines what is being observed, measured, or asked, as specifically as possible. The code should always align with the concept of the element, but may be more specific, for example, a blood pressure observation can be coded as a sitting blood pressure or standing blood pressure."
		Value:			CodeableConcept
		
		Element:		FocalProblem
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A condition that is the target of the topic/focus/measurement of the investigation. For example, if the question involves the progression of the subject's diabetes, then the FocalProblem would be diabetes."
		Value:			ref(Problem)
		
		Element:		FocalIntervention
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The intervention or treatment that is the target of the topic/focus/measurement of the investigation. For example, if the investigation involves the toxicity of chemotherapy regimen, the intervention would be that regimen (currently the MedicationUse of the chemotherapy drug)."
		Value:			ref(Procedure) or ref(MedicationUse) // TODO: could we directly say "Intervention" if all these types are defined as Interventions?
		
		Element:		AssociatedStudy
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The clinical trial or other formal study related to this finding."
		0..1			Title
		0..1			Identifier

		Element:		ObservationQualifier
		Concept:		MTH#C1443279
		Description:	"A description of the conditions or context of an observation, for example, under sedation, fasting or post-exercise. Body position and body site are also qualifiers, but handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		Method
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The method of the observation, for example, the specific imaging technical or assessment vehicle."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ClinicallyRelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the observation addresses. The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium)."
		Value:			GeneralizedTemporalContext
		
		Element:		DataAbsentReason
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Provides a reason why the value of the observation is missing, if it is expected (some observations are not expected to have a value)."
		
		Element:		Members
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Members represent the elements of a group of a related observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent observation, but the grouping reflects a common specimen, lab analysis, or clinician-author."
		Value:			0..* Observation
		
		Element:		Components
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Components are sub-parts of an observation that are always treated a part of a single observation; they are not separable. However, the reference range for the primary observation value is not inherited by the component values and is required when appropriate for each component observation."
		Value:			0..* Observation

EntryElement:	CodeableConceptObservation
Based on:		Observation
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"An observation whose value is a codeable concept"
Value:			CodeableConcept

EntryElement:	QuantitativeObservation
Based on:		Observation
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"An observation whose value is a quantity"
Value:			Quantity

EntryElement:	BooleanObservation
Based on:		Observation
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"An observation whose value is a quantity"
Value:			boolean

EntryElement:	BodyStructureObservation
Concept:		MTH#C1268086
Description:	"Observation of the existence (or non-existence) distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds. The observation has a body site that allows the the structure to be located in the body. The observation identifier allows other observations of the same body structure to be related to this observation and tracked over time."
Based on:		Observation
Value:			CodeableConcept from BodyStructureVS
0..1			BodySite
0..1			NonOccurrenceModifier  // the structure does not exist at the given body site


EntryElement:	Panel
Concept:		TBD
Based on:		Observation
Description:	"A grouped set of related observations, frequently captured at the same time. An example is a complete blood count (CBC), with separate observations for hemoglobin, hematocrit, etc. Could represent the content of a diagnostic report, such as a pathology report. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual observations that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself. The panel and all its sub-observations share the same metadata (provenance)."
Value:			0..0 (Quantity or CodeableConcept or string or boolean or Range or Ratio or time or dateTime or TimePeriod)  // TODO: how can we just say 0..0 without specifying the all the possible datatypes?
0..0			DataAbsentReason


Element:		HistoryObservation
Concept:		MTH#C2004062 "History of previous events"
Based on:		Observation
Description:	"Captures some aspect of the life, health, or medical history of a subject."
				Category is MTH#C2004062 "History of previous events"
1..1			Status with CodeableConcept from NonLabObservationStatusVS




//------------ Social Observation -----------------------

Element:		SocialHistory
Concept:		MTH#C3714536
Based on:		HistoryObservation
Description:	"The external elements and conditions which surround, influence, and affect the life and development of the subject. Includes social conditions such as poverty, violence, bullying."
