Grammar:	DataElement 5.0
Namespace:	shr.observation
Description:		"The SHR Observation domain contains basic definitions used to capture information about measurements, lab tests, and assessments."
Uses:		shr.base, shr.core, shr.demographics, shr.actor, shr.lab, shr.medication, shr.condition, shr.procedure, shr.context


EntryElement: 	Observation
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"An observation includes any information about a subject that results from an act of observing, measuring, or evaluation. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, health state, functional status, environment, exposures, etc. The method of observing can vary widely, from questioning, physical examination, formal assessment vehicles, laboratory tests, imaging procedures, etc. Patient-reported information is also considered an observation, where subject and observer are the same individual."

		Element:		Interpretation
		Concept:		MTH#C0420833
		Description:	"A clinical interpretation of a measurement."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-interpretation 

		Element:		ChangeFlag
		Concept:		MTH#C1705241
		Description:	"Indicator of significant change (delta) from the last or previous measurement."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from ChangeFlagVS

		Element:		ObservationQualifier
		Concept:		MTH#C1443279
		Description:	"A description of the conditions or context of an observation, for example, under sedation, fasting or post-exercise. Body position and body site are also qualifiers, but handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		
		Element:		ClinicallyRelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the observation addresses. The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium)."
		Value:			GeneralizedTemporalContext

		Element:		DataAbsentReason
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Provides a reason why the value of the observation is missing, if it is expected (some observations are not expected to have a value)."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ReferenceRange
		Concept:		MTH#C0883335
		Description:	"The usual or acceptable range for a test result."
		Value:			TBD "Range"   // TODO: align this with FHIR



Element:		ObservationComponent
Description:	"A simplified observation consisting of a type code, value (or data absent reason), reference range, and interpretation. Can be used in place of an observation when a full observation cannot be mapped, for example, in the components of an observation. Note that although Status is required, the value is not mapped to FHIR and is essentially ignored."

0..*			ReferenceRange

		Element:		ServiceCategory
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This is used for searching, sorting and display purposes."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ReportStatus
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The status of the report associated with this panel."
		Value:			code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/diagnostic-report-status


EntryElement:	Panel
Concept:		TBD
Based on:		Observation
Description:	"A grouped set of related observations, frequently captured at the same time. An example is a complete blood count (CBC), with separate observations for hemoglobin, hematocrit, etc. Could represent the content of a diagnostic report, such as a pathology report. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual observations that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself. The panel and all its sub-observations share the same metadata (provenance)."

1..1			PanelMembers

		Element:		PanelMembers
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"PanelMembers represent the elements of a group of a related observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent observation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author."
		Value:			0..* ref(Observation)


EntryElement:	BodyStructureObservation
Concept:		MTH#C1268086
Description:	"Observation of the existence (or non-existence) distinct anatomical or pathological morphological feature or organizational pattern, acquired or innate. Examples include tissue types, tumors, and wounds. The observation has a body site that allows the the structure to be located in the body. The observation identifier allows other observations of the same body structure to be related to QualitativeValueScaleVSthis observation and tracked over time."
Based on:		Observation
Value:			CodeableConcept from BodyStructureVS

Element:   		Manifestation  // TODO: Relate to AdverseEvent, or is that something different?
Concept:		MTH#C1457887
Based on:		Observation
Description:	"A complaint or observed indication that a person has a condition or disease. Some examples of symptoms are headache, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and pain."
Value:			CodeableConcept from ManifestationVS
				Category is #symptom
0..1			Severity  // TODO: Grade?

Element:		SocialHistory
Concept:		MTH#C3714536
Based on:		Observation
Description:	"The external elements and conditions which surround, influence, and affect the life and development of the subject. Includes social conditions such as poverty, violence, bullying."
1..1			Status from NonLabObservationStatusVS
				Category is #social-history "social history"

Element:		Evidence
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"An observation that serves as evidence for some type of assessment."
Value:			CodeableConcept or ref(Observation)
