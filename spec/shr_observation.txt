EntryElement: 	Observation
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"An act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. The method of observing can be via direct questions, formal assessment vehicle, laboratory test, or imaging procedure."

		Element:		ObservationCode
		Based on:		ActionCode
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A term from a controlled vocabulary that defines the data element (the question, not the answer) as specifically as possible. The specific code should always align with the concept of the element, but may be more specific. For example, the concept associated with medications is code for 'medication used', but the ObservationCode is the code for the particular medication used. For tests, ObservationCode identifies the specific test being performed, and for observations, the specific question being asked."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ObservationCategory
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A categorization of the observation according to how the observation was collected or its clinical area."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category or CodeableConcept

		Element:		ObservationReason
		Concept:		TBD
		Based on:		Reason
		Description:	"The reason for making the observation."

		Element:		ObservationNonOccurrenceModifier
		Concept:		TBD
		Based on:		NonOccurrenceModifier
		Description:	"True if the observation did not occcur, e.g., if a test was not performed or the assessment was not done, when it might otherwise be expected."
						Reason with CodeableConcept from ObservationNotMadeReasonVS

		Element: 		ObservationStatus
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A qualifier describing the stage or administrative state of the observation. If not given, it is assumed the status is final."
		Value:			code from 		http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-status

		Element:		ObservationQualifier
		Concept:		MTH#C1443279
		Description:	"A description of the conditions or context of an observation, for example, under sedation, fasting or post-exercise. Body position and body site are also qualifiers, but handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a fasting blood sugar is still a blood sugar."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ObservationMethod
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The method of the observation, for example, the specific imaging technical or assessment vehicle."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

		Element:		ClinicallyRelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the observation addresses. The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium)."
		Value:			GeneralizedTemporalContext


EntryElement:	Panel
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A group of related observations, usually taken together. Typically the ObservationCategory and ObservationReason are not given for panel observations, but rather given at the level of the panel itself."
