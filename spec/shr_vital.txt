Based on:		VitalSign
Description:	"Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood by Pulse oximetry."
// Argo, US Core and CIMI use LNC#59408-5 "Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood by Pulse oximetry" but FHIR R4 changes to 2708-6 "Oxygen saturation in Arterial blood" (which is good because it doesn't presume a method.)
