/*-------------- Basic Data Elements related to measurements -------------

Element:		MeasurementMethod
Concept:		MTH#C1299991
Description:	"The technique used to carry out a measurement"
Value:			Coding
	
Element:		MeasurementQualifier
Concept:		MTH#C1443279
Description:	"A description of the conditions or context of a measurement, for example, post-exercise. Body position and body site are handled separately. A qualifier cannot modify the measurement type; for example, a sitting blood pressure is still a blood pressure."
Value:			Coding

Element:		MeasurementBodySite
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The place on or in the body where a measurement is taken"
Value:			BodySite

Element:		MinMaxOrMean
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Whether a quantity represents a minimum, maximum, or mean (average) value, and over what time period"
Value: 			Coding from MinMaxMean

Element:		SustainedMeasurementDuration
Concept:		MTH#C1442476
Description:	"The length of time a measurement was continued if observed over an extended period of time (as opposed to a point-in-time reading); for example, monitoring over 24 hours to obtain a daily max, min, mean respiratory rate "
Value:			Duration
