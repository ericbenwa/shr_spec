Grammar:			DataElement 5.0
Namespace:			shr.context
Description:		"The Context Core Package defines the high-level clinical statement context classes. Three types of contexts are currently defined in CIMI: (1) Finding Contexts, (2) Action Contexts, and (3) Event Contexts. Finding contexts are used to specify whether a finding was observed to be present or absent. Action contexts are used to specify whether a clinical activity was performed, ordered, planned, or perhaps not performed."

//-------------  ActionContext and Children -----------//

Element:		ActionContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A deed or endeavor; an action taken to address a undesired health state, behavior, risk, or goal. An action can have various contexts: definitional, occurred/not occurred, ordered/not ordered, recommended/recommended against."
0..1			SpecificType
1..1			Status
0..*			Category
0..*			Reason   // When a class is a mix-in like ActionContext, elements like "reason" have to be explicitly attached to the parent, i.e., by naming it ActionReason or ReasonOfAction, CategoryOfAction, StatusOfAction, SpecificTypeOfAction. However, if the class is used as a subobject, then this is not necessary, because the path will be Foo.Action.Reason, Foo.
