Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.topic
Description:	"The Topic Core package contains the top-level specializations of the Statement Topic class, namely, the FindingTopic, ActionTopic (ProcedureTopic), and EventTopic classes."
Uses:			shr.core, shr.base, cimi.core,  cimi.element, cimi.entity, cimi.statement

Element:		StatementTopic
Based on:		NonIndependent
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of clinical statement attributes that make up the clinical focus of a statement. 

StatementTopic class attributes are aligned with SNOMED CT Concept Model attributes when such an overlap exists. Note that this class does not include contextual attributes such as the nature of the action (ordered, proposed, planned, etc...), the nature of the patient state being described (e.g., present, suspected present, absent), and the attribution of this information (the who, when, where, how, why of the information recorded)."
1..1			TopicCode

		Element:		TopicCode	
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement. 
		
		For action topics, the TopicCode represents the action being described. For findings, the TopicCode represents the 'question' or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the TopicCode contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings, the TopicCode contains a code representing the condition, allergy, or other item being asserted. In all cases, the TopicCode describes the topic  of the action or the finding."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

Abstract Element:	ActionTopic
Based on:			StatementTopic

		Element:		FindingMethod
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The technique used to create the finding, for example, the specific imaging technical, lab test code, or assessment vehicle."
		Value:			CodeableConcept should be from http://loinc.org


Element:		LaboratoryObservationTopic
Based on:		ObservationTopic
Description:	"The topic composition for laboratory observations. A specimen is required, anatomical location is excluded (since the specimen indicates the collection body site). Also includes a diagnostic service (indicating the type of laboratory), not present in general observations."
1..1			ref(Specimen)
0..0			AnatomicalLocation  // AnatomicalLocation is where the Specimen was collected
				Category is OBSCAT#laboratory
0..*			DiagnosticService

		Element:		DiagnosticService
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The service completing the observations, e.g. biochemistry, microbiology, blood bank, etc."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from DiagnosticServiceVS if covered


Element:		ConditionTopic
Based on:		AssertionTopic
Description:	"A condition. 'Condition' is interpreted broadly to include disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, concern, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, worry, or trouble. 
CIMI deviation: AnatomicalLocation is included here, rather than being a property of FindingSiteAssertionTopic, since it is a common property of conditions."
				TopicCode from http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-problem if covered 
1..*			Category from ConditionCategoryVS
0..*			AnatomicalLocation
0..*			ConditionCause

		Element:	ConditionCause
		Description: "The cause of the condition. This includes such causes as disease vectors and endogenous states (e.g., macular degeneration due to diabetes), substances, medications, micro-organisms, and forces associated with the occurrence of a Condition from temporal or causative perspectives"
		Value:		CodeableConcept or ref(Entity) or ref(ClinicalStatement)
		// probably other attributes needed, such as likelihood or type of cause
