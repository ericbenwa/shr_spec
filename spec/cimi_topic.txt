Description:	"The Topic Core package contains the top-level specializations of the Statement Topic class, namely, the FindingTopic, ActionTopic (ProcedureTopic), and EventTopic classes."
Uses:			shr.core, shr.base, cimi.core,  cimi.element, cimi.entity, cimi.statement, cimi.datatypes

Element:		StatementTopic
Based on:		NonIndependent
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of clinical statement attributes that make up the clinical focus of a statement. 

StatementTopic class attributes are aligned with SNOMED CT Concept Model attributes when such an overlap exists. Note that this class does not include contextual attributes such as the nature of the action (ordered, proposed, planned, etc...), the nature of the patient state being described (e.g., present, suspected present, absent), and the attribution of this information (the who, when, where, how, why of the information recorded)."
1..1			TopicCode

		Element:		TopicCode
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement. 
		
		For action topics, the TopicCode represents the action being described. For findings, the TopicCode represents the 'question' or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the TopicCode contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings, the TopicCode contains a code representing the condition, allergy, or other item being asserted. In all cases, the TopicCode describes the topic  of the action or the finding."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

Abstract Element:	ActionTopic

		Value:			string or CodeableConcept or Identifier or ref(EntityOrRole)

Element: 		AssertionTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
