Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.core
Description:	"The namespace containing definitions for basic classes in CIMI."
Uses:			shr.core, cimi.entity

CodeSystem:		MTH = http://ncimeta.nci.nih.gov
//
Element:		Locatable 
Description:	"Abstract top level class in the CIMI hierarchy. The Locatable class reflects CIMI's implementation using Archetype Description Language (ADL). Its attributes (archetype_node_id, name, and archetype_details) are necessary to serialize CIMI definitions in ADL, but have no clinical relevance. To avoid complicating the profiles with irrelevant extensions, the attributes of Locatable have been omitted."

Element:		Independent
Based on:		Locatable
Description:	"Base class for classes in CIMI that include enough context to stand alone. Analogous to FHIR's DomainResource."


Element:		NonIndependent
Based on:		Locatable
Description:	"Base class for classes in CIMI that do not have enough context to stand alone. These elements can be used to create classes by composition."

Element:		DataType
Based on:		NonIndependent
Description:	"Serves as a common ancestor of all CIMI types which represent the core granularity of the model."

Element:		Content
Based on:		Independent
Description:	"Abstract ancestor of all concrete content types. A unit of content that makes up a composition - e.g., a clinical statement in a patient record, a simple or composite action is a knowledge document, a catalog entry in a catalog."


Element: 		InformationEntry
Based on:		Content
Concept:		MTH#C1705654
Description:	"An entry in a patient record or in a report, generally used for the documentation of clinical information about a subject of information such as a patient or a relative of the patient, asserted by a particular source, recorded, and potentially verified."
0..1			SubjectOfInformation

	Element:		SubjectOfInformation
	Description:	"The person or thing that this entry relates to, usually the Person of Record. However, not all entries have health information specifically about the patient, but in different contexts, could refer to a fetus, family member (living or dead), device, location, organization, finding, condition, or intervention.
	In contrast to CIMI, the SubjectOfInformation is not a Participation. There's no action to participate in. Participant has extra unnecessary attributes, onBehalfOf."
	Value:			ref(EntityOrRole) //ref(Patient) or ref(Group) or ref(Device) or ref(Location) or ref(RelatedPerson) or ref(Organization)
	0..1		RelationshipToSubjectOrRecord
