EntryElement:	Problem
Concept:		MTH#C0033213
Description:	"A representation of a disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, concern, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, or trouble. Problem can be used to track a problem over a period of time. By virtue of its continuity over time, Problem is different from a observation; an observation represents a point-in-time assertion or diagnosis. The two relate because a diagnosis (finding) can lead to creation of a Problem, and the Problem can have any number of related observations. A statement that a certain problem does not exist must be made using a finding (observation)"
