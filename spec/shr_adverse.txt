Element:		AdverseEvent
Based on:		ClinicalStatement
Description:	"A record of an untoward or unexpected event in a patient under treatment, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with that treatment. Adverse events may capture either a workflow breach that may or may not result in harm, but must be documented for quality improvement purposes, or an adverse finding whether or not it can be traceable to an actual workflow breach."

EntryElement:	AdverseDrugReaction
Based on:		AdverseEvent
Description:	"A noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product. To be considered an ADR, a causal relationship must be at least suspected by the medical practitioner. The principal difference between an adverse drug reaction (ADR) an adverse event (AE) and is that a causal relationship is suspected for the ADR, but is not required for the AE. Adverse drug reactions are therefore a subset of adverse event reports."

			Concept:		TBD
			Description:	"Drug suspected as possible cause of the adverse event."
			Value:			ref(Medication) or ref(MedicationAdministered) or ref(MedicationStatement)

// In truth, this should be a filter on AdverseDrugReaction, not a separate class
