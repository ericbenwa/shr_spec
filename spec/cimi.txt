Element:		Locatable 
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Abstract top level class in the hierarchy. Locatable defines the idea of 'locatability in an archetyped structure'.

Having this class at the top of the class hierarchy reflects CIMI's use of Archetype Description Language (ADL). In CIMI, Locatable brings with it three attributes that occur in every CIMI child class: archetype_node_id, name (not a healthcare-relevant name, but a name created at runtime), and archetype_details. These attributes reflect a CIMI model implementation detail, and are irrelevant to cancer detailed clinical models, and should by rights remain hidden. So as to not complicate all profiles with extra extensions, these three attributes have been omitted."


Element: 		InformationEntry
Based on:		Locatable
Concept:		MTH#C1705654
Description:	"An InformationEntry is the minimal unit independent of logical information or knowledge, such as a clinical statement in a patient record, a knowledge entry in a knowledge artifact, a product in a product catalog, etc. 

TThe CIMI-defined attributes from InformationEntry (and those inherited from Entry) have been omitted from the current model because of problems mapping between InformationEntry and FHIR DomainResource. Attributes in DomainResource (id, versionId, lastUpdated, profile, security, tag, implicitRules, language, text, contained, extension, modifierExtension) are quite different than those in InformationEntry (identifier, subjectOfInformation, attribution, additionalText, recordStatus). Reconciling these differences is outside the scope of the current ballot on breast cancer. "

Element:		ClinicalStatement
Based on:		InformationEntry
Concept:		TBD
Description: 	"A special type of information entry consisting of a topic and a context. 

The ClinicalStatement class provides the core pattern for more specific clinical statement classes, such as a statement that a finding has been found in a patient or that a procedure has been proposed by a clinical decision support system. The ClinicalStatement pattern defines the core attributes common to most clinical statements and specifies a composition pattern that encourage model component reuse and better alignment with the SNOMED CT Concept Model. A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient). At the archetype level, the topic and context components are coordinated to form the clinical statement. For instance, the composition of the ProcedureTopic with the NotPerformed context indicates that the given procedure was not performed."
1..1			StatementTopic
1..1			StatementContext
0..1			Encounter

	Element:		Encounter
	Based on:		InformationEntry
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"An abstract class that represents an encounter class. This class has been stubbed out to limit the scope of this implementation guide to classes relevant to this ballot concerning breast cancer."



Element:		StatementTopic
Based on:		Locatable
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of attributes that make up the clinical focus of an entry. 

A topic does not include contextual attributes such as the nature of the action (ordered, proposed, planned, etc.), the nature of the patient state being described (e.g., present, suspected present, absent), and the attribution of this information (the who, when, where, how, why of the information recorded)."
1..1			TopicCode

		Element:		TopicCode	
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The concept representing the finding or action that is the topic of the statement. 
		
		For action topics, the TopicCode represents the action being described. For findings, the TopicCode represents the 'question' or property being investigated. For evaluation result findings, the TopicCode contains a concept for an observable entity, such as systolic blood pressure. For assertion findings, the TopicCode contains a code representing the condition, allergy, or other item being asserted. In all cases, the TopicCode describes the topic independent of the context of the action or the finding.
		
		This attribute was named 'key' in CIMI V0.0.4. Recently, CIMI has recently moved to rename this element TopicCode, as anticipated here, to make it more clear that this is an identifier for the topic, not the context."
		Value:			CodeableConcept


Element:		StatementContext
Based on:		Locatable
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of attributes that provides the context for the topic of a clinical statement.

StatementContext provides the expressivity required to specify that an act was performed or not performed or that a finding was asserted to be present or absent for the given subject of information."
1..1			ContextCode

		Element:		ContextCode	
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code representing the ontological status of the statement, e.g., whether it exists, does not exist, is planned, etc. 
		
		Attribute aligns with the SNOMED CT Situation with Explicit Context (SWEC) Concept Model context attributes: 'Finding context (attribute)' (SCTID: 408729009) and 'Procedure context (attribute)' (SCTID: 408730004). The range allowed for this attribute shall be consistent with the SNOMED CT concept model specification for SWEC.
		
		This attribute was named 'type' in CIMI V0.0.4. However, CIMI has recently moved to rename this element ContextCode, as anticipated here, to make it more clear that this is an identifier for the context, not the topic."
		Value:			CodeableConcept

Element:		FindingContext
Based on:		StatementContext
Concept:		SCT#410514004
Description:	"The base class for representing the ontological status of a finding, e.g., present, absent, goal, risk, expectation, etc.

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, FindingContext includes the attribute 'status'. However, there are two problems with including FindingContext.status: (1) to align with FHIR, the datatype of status has to be Concept, but in CIMI, the datatype of status is Attribution, which can't be mapped. (2) Status might not have the same interpretation in all child classes. For example, in GoalContext, the status might be relative to the progress toward the goal, not the same meaning as the status of a finding."

Element:		EvaluationResultContext
Based on:		FindingContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class of contexts that can associate with EvaluationResultTopic and its subclasses."

Element:		AssertionContext
Based on:		FindingContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The parent class of contexts that can associate with AssertionTopic and its subclasses."


	Element:		PresenceContext
	Based on:		AssertionContext
	Concept:		SCT#410515003
	Description:	"PresenceContext indicates the finding in question exists or is present to some level of certainty. 
	
	For example, if the finding involves a myocardial infarction, the presence context implies that cardiac arrest has (or may have) taken place. Note that the name Presence is used rather than Present to prevent confusion with the temporal meaning of present.
	
	In CIMI Version 0.0.4, there were two classes, KnownOrSuspectedPresent and AssertionKnownOrSuspectedPresent. CIMI has decided to combine these classes and rename them to PresenceContext, as represented here."

	Element:		RecordedContext
	Based on:		EvaluationResultContext
	Concept:		TBD
	Description:	"Context for an evaluation result, used to indicate an evaluation has been made. 
	
	For example, measurement of blood pressure that has been made simply exists (although the value can be present or absent, accurate or inaccurate). The RecordedContext indicates the information presented stands on its own as presented. It can also apply to a clinical notes.
	
	The RecordedContext class did not exist in CIMI Version 0.0.4, but CIMI is the process of adding it. That change is anticipated here."

		Description:	"Indicates whether the finding is preliminary, amended, final, etc.."
		Value:			code from http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-status
	
		Element:		RelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the finding addresses.
		
		The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium)."
		Value:			dateTime or TimePeriod 

		
Element: 		FindingTopic
Based on:		StatementTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Base class - independent of context - for all kinds of determinations: questions/answers, conditions, observations, allergies, and other findings. 

The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

In CIMI V0.0.4, FindingTopic has four attributes: result, description, multimedia, and intepretation. Here, result is represented by EvaluationResultTopic.Value and AssertionTopic.Value. Description and Multimedia have been omitted for brevity. "

		Element:		FindingMethod
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The technique used to create the finding, for example, the specific imaging technical, lab test code, or assessment vehicle. In CIMI Version 0.0.4, this attribute is called 'method'."
		Value:			CodeableConcept should be from http://loinc.org
//
Abstract Element: AssertionTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The base topic for conditions, allergies, adverse events, etc. These are things that are asserted to exist or not. The Value is interpreted in the context of the class; for an AdverseSensitivityToSubstance, the value is the substance, for a ConditionPresenceStatement, the Value represents the type of condition found.

In CIMI V0.0.4, this class was called Assertion, but CIMI recently decided to change the name to AssertionTopic, as anticipated here. In CIMI V0.0.4, Assertion defines three attributes: dateAsserted, verificationStatus, and findingMethod. VerificationStatus properly only applies in the PresenceContext context, and can be found there. FindingMethod more properly belongs in FindingTopic, and can be found there."
Value:			0..1  CodeableConcept
0..1			ExceptionValue

		
Element:		EvaluationResultTopic
Based on:		FindingTopic
Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"The base class, independent of context for evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) and a value containing the result (answer). 

The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments.

CIMI Differences:
1) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, LaboratoryTestResult.specimen is 0..* but that cardinality makes it impossible to map to FHIR Observation, because Observation.specimen is 0..1. Therefore, the cardinality of Specimen is changed to 0..1 to be consistent with FHIR.
2) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, Findings (including EvaluationResult and LaboratoryTestResult) do not have related ('has-member') observations, nor components (sub-observations). These features of FHIR Observations were found to be very useful in modeling breast cancer pathology, and so they are included here. This represents a significant departure from the CIMI model.
3) In CIMI Version 0.0.4, allowable datatype for result include EmbeddedContent,  GpsLocation,  Multimedia,  ParsableContent, and other types not allowed in a FHIR Observation. To make mapping feasible, the types of Value were restricted to the allowable FHIR datatypes."

Element:		ConditionTopic
Based on:		AssertionTopic
Concept:		MTH#C0348080
Description:	"Representation of a condition, independent of context of being present, absent, risk, expectation etc. 'Condition' is interpreted broadly to include disorder, abnormality, problem, injury, complaint, functionality, concern, illness, disease, ailment, sickness, affliction, upset, difficulty, disorder, symptom, etc. 

In CIMI Version 0.0.4, the corresponding class is ConditionAssertion, but this name has been changed to ConditionTopic, as anticipated here. ConditionAssertion had properties associated with the presence of the condition, including severity, dueTo, diseasePhase, and more. In the current logical model, any properties associated with condition occurrence have been placed with ConditionPresenceContext.

The presence of terminology bindings (necessary to align with FHIR Condition.category and enforce the extensible binding in US Core of Condition.code) means that this class cannot be defined entirely within the CIMI reference model. The constraints could only exist in an archetype derived from the reference model class. The logical model here represents both the class structure and the terminology bindings."

Concept:			TBD
Description:		"Base class for human, material, and informational things. A non-material thing might be a goal or information relevant to health care, such as an image, consent form, or report. A material thing can be seen and touched, such as a device.

In CIMI V0.0.4, Entities were not stand-alone classes. However, this is currently being changed in CIMI, so in the future, CIMI entities will more closely correspond to the FHIR entity-like resources such as Organization, Location, Device, Substance, and the like. In order to map to FHIR and produce profiles for this ballot, this change has been anticipated.

Further, in CIMI V0.0.4, Entity was a subclass of Party. Party is part of CIMI's participation model that is currently undergoing review and revision. Rather than introducing the complexity the CIMI participation model, which has little relevance to the current ballot of cancer profiles and is undergoing revision anyway, the superclass Party has been omitted."
