EntryElement:	Assertion
Based on:		Observation
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"An Assertion is an observation that takes the form of a single asserted code, without an explicit question. Examples include reported symptoms such as constipation, chest pain, or bleeding (the latter with a body site). Also applies to simple reports such as 'patient's bed in low position for safety' or 'pacemaker present'. The question code is defaulted to 'assertion' since there is no explicit question. Assertions may include a body site."

Description:	"A grouped set of related findings, frequently captured at the same time. An example is a complete blood count (CBC), with separate observations for hemoglobin, hematocrit, etc. Could represent the content of a diagnostic report, such as a pathology report. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual findings that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself. The panel and all its sub-observations share the same metadata (provenance)."

		Element:		Members
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Members represent the elements of a group of a related observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report.
