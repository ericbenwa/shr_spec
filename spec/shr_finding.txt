Abstract Element:	Assertion
Based on:		Finding
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The base class for conditions, allergies, risks, etc. These are things that are asserted to exist or not. The Value is interpreted in the context of the class; for an AdverseSensitivityToSubstance, the value is the substance, for a Condition, the Value represents the type of condition found. For this reason, a separate ObservationCode is not required for descendants of Assertion."

Concept:		MTH#C1554188
Description:	"Base class - independent of context - for evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) and a value containing the result (answer).

		Element:		ObservationCode
		Concept:		MTH#C1706203
		Description:	"A code that represents what the finding concerns, for example, the subject's height, blood pressure, disease status, wound dimensions, diabetes risk, etc. Although named ObservationCode, in different contexts the same attribute might be more naturally referred to as a property, observable, or test code. In assertions (observations without an explicit question), the observation code is defaulted to the concept code."
		Value:			CodeableConcept 

		Element:		RelevantTime
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The time or time period that the finding addresses. The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium)."

				Element:	ApplicableAgeRange
				Concept:	TBD

		Element:		Members
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Members represent the elements of a group of a related but independent observations. Examples are the measurements that compose a complete blood count (CBC), or the elements of a pathology report. Each member is an independent observation, but the grouping reflects a composite lab order, shared specimen, or a single report author. Typically the Category and Reason are not given for individual findings that are part of the panel, but rather given at the level of the panel itself."
		// Lloyd McKenzie said "has-member is for things like panels. For example, a CBC (complete blood count) would have members capturing white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, etc.  See https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/search/cbc "
		Value:			0..* ref(EvaluationResult)
		
	
EntryElement:	EvaluationResult
Based on:		EvaluationBase
