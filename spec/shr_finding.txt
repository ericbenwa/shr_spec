		Element:		Components
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Components are parts of the parent observation. Component observations share the same attributes (such as Specimen) as the primary observation and are not separable. However, the reference range may be different for each component observation."
		Value:			0..* EvaluationComponent
		

Element:		EvaluationComponent   // not Content (cannot stand alone)! 
Description:	"A simplified, non-separable observation consisting of a type code, value (or data absent reason), reference range, and interpretation. The item observered is the same as in the parent observation."
