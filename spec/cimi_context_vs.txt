ValueSet: 					ExceptionValueVS
Description:				"Reasons that a value associated with a test or other finding is missing."
#unknown					"The value is not known."
#asked						"The source human does not know the value."
#temp						"There is reason to expect (from the workflow) that the value may become known."
#not-asked					"The workflow didn't lead to this value being known."
#masked						"The information is not available due to security, privacy or related reasons."
#unsupported				"The source system wasn't capable of supporting this element."
#astext						"The content of the data is represented in the resource narrative."
#error						"Some system or workflow process error means that the information is not available."
#NaN						"NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value."
#not-performed				"The value is not available because the observation procedure  (test, etc.) was not performed."
#missing_refused			"Human source was asked but declined to respond to the question, or an applicable question was left unanswered."
#missing_noexplanation		"The reason the information is not present is not known."
#missing_nonesuch			"The answer is missing because nothing of a type of thing is known to exists, e.g., the siblings of an only child. Also use this code to represent a 'none of the above' answer"
// The following values apply to lab tests
#missing_collection			"Missing due to a problem collecting, identifying, or locating the specimen, including patient refusal or unable to provide specimen"
#missing_specimen			"Missing due to a problem with the specimen, e.g. inadequate specimen, contamination, clotting, improper tube type, improper storage, too small, etc."
#missing_malfunction		"Missing due to instrument malfunction."
