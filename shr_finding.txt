Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		shr.finding
Description:	"The SHR Finding domain contains basic definitions used to capture subjective and objective information about the subject. Things observed about the subject can include demographic facts, history, subjective and objective observations, assessments, and judgments, excluding actual or potential interventions, and range from simple answered questions to vital signs and laboratory results."
Uses:			shr.core, shr.base, shr.action, shr.entity, shr.procedure, shr.medication, shr.condition, shr.device

		Element:		EvaluationProcedurePerformed
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"The evaluation procedure that is the source of the evaluation result. The EvaluationMethod is the general method used to produce the result, while the EvaluationProcedure is a pointer to the actual instance of the procedure."
		Value:			ref(ProcedureTopic)   // can't reference ProcedurePerformed because there are no direct subclasses of ProcedurePerformed, only subclasses of ProcedureTopic and ProcedureContext. There's no way in CIMPL to indicate "Any class whose Topic is descended from ProcedureTopic and Context descended from ProcedureContext." Even multiple inheritance doesn't address this.


		
//----------------- Instantiations ------------------

EntryElement:	EvaluationGoal
Based on:		EvaluationTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Represents an evaluation result that is in the prospective (future) context, taken as a goal or objective, for example, systolic blood pressure below 140."
1..1			GoalContext

	
EntryElement:	EvaluationResultRecorded
Based on:		EvaluationTopic
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Represents the result of evaluations (measurements, tests, or questions) that have been performed. EvaluationResultRecorded has a value representing the result (answer), or an ExceptionValue indicating why the value is not present. The subject of a finding can be the entire patient, or an entity such as a location body structure, intervention, or condition. Things observed about the subject can include social and behavioral factors, subjective and objective observations, and assessments."
1..1			EvaluationResultRecordedContext
				Members value is type ref(EvaluationResultRecorded)

		Element:		ExceptionValue
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"Reason that a value associated with a test or other finding is missing."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from ExceptionValueVS

		
EntryElement:	LaboratoryTestResultRecorded
Based on:		EvaluationResultRecorded
Description:	"Measurement resulting from a laboratory analysis."

		Element:		DiagnosticService
		Concept:		TBD
		Description:	"A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, MRI). This is used for searching, sorting and display purposes."
		Value:			CodeableConcept from DiagnosticServiceVS if covered

EntryElement:	QuestionAnswerRecorded
Based on:		EvaluationResultRecorded
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"A simplified evaluation (independent of context) consisting of a question-answer pair. The question is identified by the TopicCode, and the answer (if given) is in Value. If the answer is missing, an ExceptionValue must be provided. For a series of related questions, the EvaluationResultRecorded.Members can have the supporting questions."

Description:	"Findings associated with this item." 
Value:			ref(FindingTopic)


EntryElement:	DiseaseProgression
Based on:		EvaluationResultRecorded
Concept:		MTH#C0421176 "Progression"
Description:	"A finding related to the current trend of a disease. This concept is most often used for chronic and incurable diseases where the status and trendline of the disease is an important determinant of therapy and prognosis. The specific disorder being evaluated must be cited in the Focus_Reference or Focus_CodeableConcept as a reference to a Condition."
Value:			CodeableConcept from ProgressionVS
				TopicCode is MTH#C0421176 "Progression"
