Most tumor markers are made by both normal cells and cancer cells, but they are made in larger amounts by cancer cells. A tumor marker may help to diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working or if cancer has come back. Examples of tumor markers include CA-125 (in ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (in breast cancer), CEA (in colon cancer), and PSA (in prostate cancer). (Source: NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms).  Tumor markers differ from genetic markers in that they are measured at the levels of the protein and substance post-RNA protein synthesis."
